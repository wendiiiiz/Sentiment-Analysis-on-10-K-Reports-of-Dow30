THE COMPANY\\x92S RESULTS FOR 2010 REFLECTED STRONG SPENDING     GROWTH AND IMPROVED CREDIT PERFORMANCE. THROUGHOUT THE YEAR     CARDMEMBER SPENDING VOLUMES GREW BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND     INTERNATIONALLY, AND ACROSS ALL OF THE COMPANY\\x92S     BUSINESSES. CARDMEMBER SPENDING LEVELS IN 2010 REACHED RECORD     LEVELS AT THE END OF THE YEAR. IMPROVING CREDIT TRENDS     CONTRIBUTED TO THE REDUCTION IN LOAN AND RECEIVABLE WRITE-OFFS     AND THE REDUCTION OF LOSS RESERVE LEVELS OVER THE COURSE OF 2010     WHEN COMPARED TO 2009. IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE     YEAR-OVER-YEAR     BENEFITS FROM IMPROVING CREDIT TRENDS WILL DECREASE OVER THE     COURSE OF 2011. WHILE THE COMPANY INVESTED AT HISTORICALLY HIGH     LEVELS IN 2010, IT INTENDS TO MAINTAIN THE FLEXIBILITY TO SCALE     BACK ON INVESTMENTS AS BUSINESS CONDITIONS CHANGE AND THE     BENEFITS REALIZED FROM IMPROVING CREDIT TRENDS LESSEN.         DESPITE IMPROVEMENT IN PARTS OF THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT,     CHALLENGES CLEARLY REMAIN FOR THE COMPANY, BOTH IN THE UNITED     STATES AND IN MANY OTHER KEY REGIONS. THESE CHALLENGES INCLUDE     WEAK JOB CREATION, VOLATILE CONSUMER CONFIDENCE, CONSUMER     BEHAVIOR, AN UNCERTAIN HOUSING MARKET, AND THE REGULATORY AND     LEGISLATIVE ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING THE UNCERTAIN IMPACT OF THE     CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTABILITY RESPONSIBILITY AND DISCLOSURE ACT OF     2009 (THE \\x93CARD ACT\\x94), OF THE RECENTLY ENACTED     DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT     (\\x93DODD-FRANK\\x94) AND OF THE PROCEEDING AGAINST THE     COMPANY RECENTLY BROUGHT BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE     (\\x93DOJ\\x94) AND CERTAIN STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL ALLEGING A     VIOLATION OF THE U.S. ANTITRUST LAWS. IN ADDITION, AS     PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED, THE COMPANY WILL STOP RECEIVING QUARTERLY     LITIGATION PAYMENTS FROM MASTERCARD INTERNATIONAL, INC.     (\\x93MASTERCARD\\x94) AND VISA INC. (\\x93VISA\\x94) AT THE     END OF THE SECOND AND FOURTH QUARTERS OF 2011, RESPECTIVELY, AND     YEAR-OVER-YEAR     COMPARISONS WILL BE MORE DIFFICULT TO MAINTAIN IN LIGHT OF THE     STRONG 2010 RESULTS.         IN 2011, THE COMPANY WILL BE PARTICULARLY FOCUSED ON SEVERAL     INITIATIVES DESIGNED TO HELP US ACCOMPLISH OUR LONG-TERM GROWTH     GOALS: PROVIDING GREATER VALUE TO MERCHANTS; ADDING MORE WOMEN,     MINORITIES AND YOUNGER ADULTS TO OUR CUSTOMER BASE; ACCELERATING     OUR GROWTH OUTSIDE THE U.S.; MAKING SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN THE     ENTERPRISE GROWTH GROUP; AND INCREASING OUR SHARE OF ONLINE     SPENDING ACROSS ALL PRODUCTS WHILE TRANSFORMING OUR     CUSTOMERS\\x92 DIGITAL EXPERIENCE.         WE ALSO CONTINUE TO SEEK MORE WAYS TO TURN EXISTING CAPABILITIES     AND RELATIONSHIPS INTO NEW FEE SERVICES. IN THE PAST EIGHTEEN     MONTHS, WE LAUNCHED OR EXPANDED SEVERAL KEY INITIATIVES,     INCLUDING BUSINESS INSIGHTS, WHICH PROVIDES ANALYTICS AND     CONSULTING SERVICES TO HELP MERCHANTS ATTRACT MORE CUSTOMERS AND     INCREASE SALES, AND ACCEPTPAY, WHICH SIMPLIFIES THE INVOICING     AND PAYMENT PROCESS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. OVERALL, WE SET AN     AGGRESSIVE GOAL TO GENERATE $3 BILLION IN ANNUAL FEE-BASED     REVENUES FOR THE COMPANY BY THE END OF 2014.

FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF REVENUE,     SEE PAGES 72-73 OF THE 2010 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS.     PRODUCTS     AND SERVICES         THE COMPANY\\x92S RANGE OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES INCLUDES:                 \\x95        CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD PRODUCTS            \\x95        EXPENSE MANAGEMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES            \\x95        CONSUMER AND BUSINESS TRAVEL SERVICES            \\x95        STORED VALUE PRODUCTS SUCH AS TRAVELERS CHEQUES AND OTHER     PREPAID PRODUCTS            \\x95        NETWORK SERVICES            \\x95        MERCHANT ACQUISITION AND PROCESSING,     POINT-OF-SALE,     SERVICING AND SETTLEMENT, AND MARKETING AND INFORMATION PRODUCTS     AND SERVICES FOR MERCHANTS; AND           2    TABLE OF CONTENTS                  \\x95        FEE SERVICES, INCLUDING MARKET AND TREND ANALYSES AND RELATED     CONSULTING SERVICES, FRAUD PREVENTION SERVICES, AND THE DESIGN     OF CUSTOMIZED CUSTOMER LOYALTY AND REWARDS PROGRAMS.           THE COMPANY\\x92S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE SOLD GLOBALLY TO     DIVERSE CUSTOMER GROUPS, INCLUDING CONSUMERS, SMALL BUSINESSES,     MID-SIZED COMPANIES AND LARGE CORPORATIONS. THESE PRODUCTS AND     SERVICES ARE SOLD THROUGH VARIOUS CHANNELS, INCLUDING DIRECT     MAIL, ON-LINE APPLICATIONS, TARGETED DIRECT AND THIRD-PARTY     SALES FORCES, AND DIRECT RESPONSE ADVERTISING.         THE COMPANY\\x92S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES GENERATE THE FOLLOWING     TYPES OF REVENUE FOR THE COMPANY:                 \\x95        DISCOUNT REVENUE, THE COMPANY\\x92S LARGEST REVENUE SOURCE,     WHICH REPRESENTS FEES CHARGED TO MERCHANTS WHEN CARDMEMBERS USE     THEIR CARDS TO PURCHASE GOODS AND SERVICES ON THE COMPANY\\x92S     NETWORK;            \\x95        NET CARD FEES, WHICH REPRESENT REVENUE EARNED FOR ANNUAL CHARGE     CARD MEMBERSHIPS;            \\x95        TRAVEL COMMISSIONS AND FEES, WHICH ARE EARNED BY CHARGING A     TRANSACTION OR MANAGEMENT FEE FOR AIRLINE OR OTHER     TRAVEL-RELATED TRANSACTIONS;            \\x95        OTHER COMMISSIONS AND FEES, WHICH ARE EARNED ON FOREIGN EXCHANGE     CONVERSIONS AND CARD-RELATED FEES AND ASSESSMENTS;            \\x95        OTHER REVENUE, WHICH REPRESENTS INSURANCE PREMIUMS EARNED FROM     CARDMEMBER TRAVEL AND OTHER INSURANCE PROGRAMS, REVENUES ARISING     FROM CONTRACTS WITH GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES\\x92 PARTNERS     (INCLUDING ROYALTIES AND SIGNING FEES), PUBLISHING REVENUES AND     OTHER MISCELLANEOUS REVENUE AND FEES; AND            \\x95        INTEREST AND FEES ON LOANS, WHICH PRINCIPALLY REPRESENTS     INTEREST INCOME EARNED ON OUTSTANDING BALANCES, AND CARD FEES     RELATED TO THE CARDMEMBER LOANS PORTFOLIO.           OUR GENERAL-PURPOSE CARD NETWORK, CARD-ISSUING AND     MERCHANT-ACQUIRING AND PROCESSING BUSINESSES ARE GLOBAL IN     SCOPE. WE ARE A WORLD LEADER IN PROVIDING CHARGE AND CREDIT     CARDS TO CONSUMERS, SMALL BUSINESSES AND CORPORATIONS. THESE     CARDS INCLUDE CARDS ISSUED BY AMERICAN EXPRESS AS WELL AS CARDS     ISSUED BY THIRD-PARTY BANKS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE     ACCEPTED ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK (COLLECTIVELY,     \\x93CARDS\\x94). OUR CARDS PERMIT OUR CARDMEMBERS     (\\x93CARDMEMBERS\\x94) TO CHARGE PURCHASES OF GOODS AND     SERVICES IN MOST COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD AT THE MILLIONS OF     MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT CARDS BEARING OUR LOGO. AT     DECEMBER 31, 2010, WE HAD TOTAL WORLDWIDE     CARDS-IN-FORCE     OF 91.0 MILLION (INCLUDING CARDS ISSUED BY THIRD PARTIES).     IN 2010, OUR WORLDWIDE BILLED BUSINESS (SPENDING ON AMERICAN     EXPRESS®      CARDS, INCLUDING CARDS ISSUED BY THIRD PARTIES) WAS     $713 BILLION.         THE COMPANY HAS ALSO RECENTLY CREATED AN ENTERPRISE GROWTH GROUP     TO FOCUS ON GENERATING ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF REVENUE ON A     GLOBAL BASIS, BOTH ORGANICALLY AND THROUGH ACQUISITIONS, IN     AREAS SUCH AS ONLINE AND MOBILE PAYMENTS AND FEE-BASED SERVICES.     FOR A DISCUSSION CONCERNING OUR ENTERPRISE GROWTH GROUP, PLEASE     SEE \\x93CORPORATE & OTHER\\x94 BELOW.         OUR BUSINESS AS A WHOLE HAS NOT EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT SEASONAL     FLUCTUATIONS, ALTHOUGH TRAVEL SALES GENERALLY TEND TO BE HIGHEST     IN THE SECOND AND FOURTH QUARTERS. TRAVELERS CHEQUE SALES AND     TRAVELERS CHEQUES OUTSTANDING TEND TO BE GREATEST EACH YEAR IN     THE SUMMER MONTHS, PEAKING IN THE THIRD QUARTER. AMERICAN     EXPRESS®      GIFT CARD SALES ARE HIGHEST IN THE MONTHS OF NOVEMBER AND     DECEMBER; AND CARD BILLED BUSINESS TENDS TO BE MODERATELY HIGHER     IN THE FOURTH QUARTER THAN IN OTHER QUARTERS.     SPEND-CENTRIC     MODEL IS COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE         DESPITE THE CONTINUING CHALLENGES OF THE CURRENT ECONOMIC     ENVIRONMENT, WE BELIEVE OUR \\x93SPEND-CENTRIC\\x94 BUSINESS     MODEL (WHICH FOCUSES ON GENERATING REVENUES PRIMARILY BY DRIVING     SPENDING ON OUR CARDS AND SECONDARILY BY FINANCE CHARGES AND     FEES) CONTINUES TO GIVE US SIGNIFICANT COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES.     AVERAGE SPENDING ON OUR CARDS, WHICH IS SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER ON     A PER-CARD BASIS FOR US VERSUS OUR COMPETITORS, REPRESENTS     GREATER VALUE TO MERCHANTS IN THE FORM OF LOYAL CUSTOMERS AND     HIGHER SALES. THIS ENABLES US TO EARN PREMIUM DISCOUNT RATES AND     THEREBY INVEST IN GREATER VALUE-ADDED SERVICES FOR MERCHANTS AND     CARDMEMBERS. AS A RESULT OF THE HIGHER REVENUES GENERATED FROM     HIGHER SPENDING CARDMEMBERS, WE HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO INVEST     IN MORE ATTRACTIVE REWARDS AND OTHER INCENTIVES TO CARDMEMBERS,     AND TARGETED MARKETING AND OTHER          3    TABLE OF CONTENTS        PROGRAMS AND INVESTMENTS FOR MERCHANTS, ALL OF WHICH IN TURN     CREATE INCENTIVES FOR CARDMEMBERS TO SPEND MORE ON THEIR CARDS.     THE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS WE MAKE IN REWARDS AND OTHER     COMPELLING VALUE PROPOSITIONS FOR CARDMEMBERS DRIVE CARD USAGE     AT MERCHANTS AND ENCOURAGE CARDMEMBER LOYALTY. THIS BUSINESS     MODEL, ALONG WITH OUR CLOSED-LOOP NETWORK, IN WHICH WE ARE BOTH     THE CARD ISSUER AND, IN MOST INSTANCES, THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER,     GIVES US A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE THAT WE SEEK TO LEVERAGE TO     PROVIDE MORE VALUE TO CARDMEMBERS, MERCHANTS AND OUR     CARD-ISSUING PARTNERS.     THE     AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND         OUR BRAND AND ITS ATTRIBUTES\\x97TRUST, SECURITY, INTEGRITY,     QUALITY AND CUSTOMER SERVICE\\x97ARE KEY ASSETS OF THE COMPANY.     WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON OUR BRAND BY EDUCATING EMPLOYEES ABOUT     THESE ATTRIBUTES AND BY INCORPORATING THEM INTO OUR PROGRAMS,     PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. OUR BRAND HAS CONSISTENTLY BEEN RATED ONE     OF THE MOST VALUABLE BRANDS IN THE WORLD IN PUBLISHED STUDIES,     AND WE BELIEVE IT PROVIDES US WITH A SIGNIFICANT COMPETITIVE     ADVANTAGE.         WE BELIEVE OUR BRAND AND ITS ATTRIBUTES ARE CRITICAL TO OUR     SUCCESS, AND WE INVEST HEAVILY IN MANAGING, MARKETING AND     PROMOTING IT. IN ADDITION, WE PLACE SIGNIFICANT IMPORTANCE ON     TRADEMARKS, SERVICE MARKS AND PATENTS, AND DILIGENTLY PROTECT     OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AROUND THE WORLD.      GLOBAL     NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICES          THE GLOBAL NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICES     (\\x93GNMS\\x94) SEGMENT OPERATES A GLOBAL GENERAL-PURPOSE     CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD NETWORK FOR BOTH PROPRIETARY CARDS AND     CARDS ISSUED UNDER THE GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES BUSINESS. IT ALSO     MANAGES MERCHANT SERVICES GLOBALLY, WHICH INCLUDES SIGNING     MERCHANTS TO ACCEPT CARDS AS WELL AS PROCESSING AND SETTLING     CARD TRANSACTIONS FOR THOSE MERCHANTS. THIS SEGMENT ALSO OFFERS     MERCHANTS     POINT-OF-SALE,     SERVICING AND SETTLEMENT, FRAUD PREVENTION SERVICES, AND     MARKETING AND INFORMATION PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.         CARDS BEARING OUR LOGO ARE ISSUED BY OUR PRINCIPAL OPERATING     SUBSIDIARY, TRS, BY THE COMPANY\\x92S U.S. BANK     SUBSIDIARIES, AMERICAN EXPRESS CENTURION BANK (\\x93CENTURION     BANK\\x94) AND AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK, FSB (\\x93AEBFSB\\x94),     AND BY OTHER OPERATING AND BANK SUBSIDIARIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED     STATES. THEY ARE ACCEPTED AT ALL MERCHANT LOCATIONS WORLDWIDE     THAT ACCEPT AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED CARDS. IN ADDITION,     DEPENDING ON THE PRODUCT, CARDS BEARING OUR LOGO ARE GENERALLY     ACCEPTED AT ATM LOCATIONS WORLDWIDE THAT ACCEPT CARDS. TRS AND     ITS SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, ISSUE THE     MAJORITY OF CARDS ON OUR NETWORK.         OUR GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES (\\x93GNS\\x94) BUSINESS     ESTABLISHES AND MAINTAINS RELATIONSHIPS WITH BANKS AND OTHER     INSTITUTIONS AROUND THE WORLD THAT ISSUE CARDS AND, IN CERTAIN     COUNTRIES, ACQUIRE LOCAL MERCHANTS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS     NETWORK. GNS IS KEY TO OUR STRATEGY OF BROADENING THE CARDMEMBER     AND MERCHANT BASE FOR OUR NETWORK WORLDWIDE.         OUR GLOBAL MERCHANT SERVICES (\\x93GMS\\x94) BUSINESS PROVIDES     US WITH ACCESS TO RICH TRANSACTION DATA THROUGH OUR CLOSED-LOOP     NETWORK, WHICH ENCOMPASSES RELATIONSHIPS WITH BOTH THE     CARDMEMBER AND THE MERCHANT. THIS CAPABILITY HELPS US ACQUIRE     NEW MERCHANTS, DEEPEN RELATIONSHIPS WITH EXISTING MERCHANTS,     PROCESS TRANSACTIONS, AND PROVIDE TARGETED MARKETING, ANALYTICAL     AND OTHER VALUE-ADDED SERVICES TO MERCHANTS IN OUR NETWORK. IN     ADDITION, IT ALLOWS US TO ANALYZE TRENDS AND SPENDING PATTERNS     AMONG VARIOUS SEGMENTS OF OUR CUSTOMER BASE.     GLOBAL     NETWORK SERVICES         WE CONTINUE TO PURSUE A STRATEGY, THROUGH OUR GNS BUSINESS, OF     INVITING U.S. AND FOREIGN BANKS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS TO     ISSUE CARDS AND ACQUIRE MERCHANTS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS     NETWORK. BY LEVERAGING OUR GLOBAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE APPEAL     OF THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND, WE BROADEN OUR CARDMEMBER AND     MERCHANT BASE FOR OUR NETWORK WORLDWIDE. THE GNS BUSINESS HAS     ESTABLISHED 129 CARD-ISSUING     AND/OR     MERCHANT-ACQUIRING ARRANGEMENTS WITH BANKS AND OTHER     INSTITUTIONS IN 131 COUNTRIES.         4    TABLE OF CONTENTS        IN 2010, GNS SIGNED FOUR NEW PARTNERS TO ISSUE CARDS     AND/OR     ACQUIRE MERCHANTS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK. ADDITIONALLY,     GNS PARTNERS LAUNCHED APPROXIMATELY 77 NEW PRODUCTS DURING 2010,     BRINGING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED GNS     PARTNER PRODUCTS TO APPROXIMATELY 1,000.         GNS FOCUSES ON PARTNERING WITH QUALIFIED THIRD-PARTY BANKS AND     OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT CHOOSE TO ISSUE CARDS ACCEPTED     ON OUR GLOBAL NETWORK     AND/OR     ACQUIRE MERCHANTS ON OUR NETWORK. ALTHOUGH WE CUSTOMIZE OUR     NETWORK ARRANGEMENTS TO THE PARTICULAR COUNTRY AND EACH     PARTNER\\x92S REQUIREMENTS, AS WELL AS TO OUR STRATEGIC PLANS     IN THAT MARKETPLACE, ALL GNS ARRANGEMENTS ARE DESIGNED TO HELP     ISSUERS DEVELOP PRODUCTS FOR THEIR HIGHEST-SPENDING AND MOST     AFFLUENT CUSTOMERS AND TO SUPPORT THE VALUE OF AMERICAN EXPRESS     CARD ACCEPTANCE TO MERCHANTS. WE CHOOSE TO PARTNER WITH     INSTITUTIONS THAT SHARE A CORE SET OF ATTRIBUTES COMPATIBLE WITH     THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND, SUCH AS COMMITMENT TO HIGH QUALITY     STANDARDS AND STRONG MARKETING EXPERTISE, AND WE REQUIRE     ADHERENCE TO OUR PRODUCT, BRAND AND SERVICE STANDARDS.**         AS DISCUSSED BELOW, WHILE GNS HAS ADDED SIGNIFICANT PARTNERS IN     2010, A CORE STRATEGY OF GNS IS TO BUILD AND INVEST IN DEEPER     AND MORE MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIPS WITH ITS EXISTING PARTNERS.         WITH APPROXIMATELY 1,000 DIFFERENT CARD PRODUCTS LAUNCHED ON OUR     NETWORK SO FAR BY OUR PARTNERS, GNS IS AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT     BUSINESS THAT IS STRENGTHENING OUR BRAND VISIBILITY AROUND THE     WORLD, DRIVING MORE TRANSACTION VOLUME ONTO OUR MERCHANT NETWORK     AND INCREASING THE NUMBER OF MERCHANTS ACCEPTING THE AMERICAN     EXPRESS CARD. GNS ENABLES US TO EXPAND OUR NETWORK\\x92S GLOBAL     PRESENCE GENERALLY WITHOUT ASSUMING ADDITIONAL CARDMEMBER CREDIT     RISK OR HAVING TO INVEST A LARGE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES, AS OUR GNS     PARTNERS ALREADY HAVE ESTABLISHED ATTRACTIVE CUSTOMER BASES THEY     CAN TARGET WITH AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED PRODUCTS, AND ARE     RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING THE CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE     CARDS THEY ISSUE. SINCE 1999,     CARDS-IN-FORCE     ISSUED BY GNS PARTNERS HAVE GROWN AT A COMPOUND ANNUAL GROWTH     RATE OF 24%, AND TOTALED OVER 29 MILLION CARDS AT THE END     OF 2010. OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, 75% OF NEW CARDS ISSUED IN     2010 WERE CARDS ISSUED BY GNS PARTNERS. SPENDING ON GNS CARDS     HAS GROWN AT A COMPOUND ANNUAL RATE OF 25% SINCE 1999.     YEAR-OVER-YEAR     SPENDING GROWTH ON THESE CARDS IN 2010 WAS 28%, WITH TOTAL     SPENDING EQUAL TO $92 BILLION.         IN ASSESSING WHETHER A GIVEN COUNTRY SHOULD BE PROPRIETARY, GNS,     OR SOME COMBINATION THEREOF, WE CONSIDER A WIDE RANGE OF     COUNTRY-SPECIFIC FACTORS INCLUDING THE STABILITY AND     ATTRACTIVENESS OF RETURNS, THE SIZE OF THE AFFLUENT SEGMENT, THE     STRENGTH OF AVAILABLE MARKETING AND CREDIT DATA, THE SIZE OF     CO-BRAND OPPORTUNITIES AND HOW BEST CAN WE CREATE STRONG     MERCHANT VALUE.     GNS     ARRANGEMENTS         ALTHOUGH THE STRUCTURES AND DETAILS OF EACH OF THE GNS     ARRANGEMENTS VARY, ALL OF THEM GENERATE REVENUES FOR US FROM THE     CARD TRANSACTION VOLUMES THEY DRIVE ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS     NETWORK. GROSS REVENUES WE RECEIVE PER DOLLAR SPENT ON A CARD     ISSUED BY A GNS PARTNER ARE GENERALLY LOWER THAN THOSE FROM OUR     PROPRIETARY CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS. HOWEVER, BECAUSE THE GNS     PARTNER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MOST OF THE OPERATING COSTS AND RISK     OF ITS CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS, OUR OPERATING EXPENSES AND CREDIT     LOSSES ARE GENERALLY LOWER THAN THOSE IN OUR PROPRIETARY     CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS. THE GNS BUSINESS MODEL GENERATES AN     ATTRACTIVE EARNINGS STREAM AND RISK PROFILE THAT REQUIRES A     LOWER LEVEL OF CAPITAL SUPPORT. THE RETURN ON EQUITY IN OUR GNS     BUSINESS CAN THUS BE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THAT OF OUR     PROPRIETARY CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, SINCE THE     MAJORITY OF GNS COSTS ARE FIXED, THE GNS BUSINESS IS HIGHLY     SCALABLE. GNS PARTNERS BENEFIT FROM THEIR ASSOCIATION WITH THE     AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND AND THEIR ABILITY TO GAIN ATTRACTIVE     REVENUE STREAMS AND EXPAND AND DIFFERENTIATE THEIR PRODUCT     OFFERINGS WITH INNOVATIVE MARKETING PROGRAMS.         OUR GNS ARRANGEMENTS FALL INTO THE FOLLOWING THREE MAIN     CATEGORIES: INDEPENDENT OPERATOR ARRANGEMENTS, NETWORK CARD     LICENSE ARRANGEMENTS AND JOINT VENTURE ARRANGEMENTS.                  ** THE USE OF THE TERM     \\x93PARTNER\\x94 OR \\x93PARTNERING\\x94 DOES NOT MEAN OR     IMPLY A FORMAL LEGAL PARTNERSHIP, AND IS NOT MEANT IN ANY WAY TO     ALTER THE TERMS OF AMERICAN EXPRESS\\x92 RELATIONSHIP WITH     THIRD-PARTY ISSUERS AND MERCHANT ACQUIRERS.         5    TABLE OF CONTENTS    INDEPENDENT     OPERATOR ARRANGEMENTS         THE FIRST TYPE OF GNS ARRANGEMENT IS KNOWN AS AN INDEPENDENT     OPERATOR (\\x93IO\\x94) ARRANGEMENT. AS OF THE END OF 2010, WE     HAD 64 OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS AROUND THE WORLD. WE PURSUE THESE     ARRANGEMENTS TO EXPAND THE PRESENCE OF THE AMERICAN EXPRESS     NETWORK IN COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE DO NOT OFFER A PROPRIETARY     LOCAL CURRENCY CARD. THE PARTNER\\x92S LOCAL PRESENCE AND     RELATIONSHIPS HELP US ENHANCE THE IMPACT OF OUR BRAND IN THE     COUNTRY, REACH MERCHANT COVERAGE GOALS MORE QUICKLY, AND OPERATE     AT ECONOMIC SCALE AND COST LEVELS THAT WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR US     TO ACHIEVE ON OUR OWN. SUBJECT TO MEETING OUR STANDARDS, IO BANK     PARTNERS ARE LICENSED TO ISSUE LOCAL CURRENCY CARDS IN THEIR     COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE CLASSIC GREEN, GOLD AND PLATINUM     AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS. IN ADDITION, THE MAJORITY OF THESE     PARTNERS SERVE AS THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER AND PROCESSOR FOR LOCAL     MERCHANTS. AMERICAN EXPRESS RETAINS THE RELATIONSHIP WITH     MULTINATIONAL MERCHANTS. OUR IO PARTNERS OWN THE CUSTOMER     RELATIONSHIPS AND CREDIT RISK FOR THE CARDS THEY ISSUE, AND MAKE     THE DECISIONS ABOUT WHICH CUSTOMERS WILL BE ISSUED CARDS. GNS     GENERATES REVENUES IN IO ARRANGEMENTS FROM CARD LICENSING FEES,     ROYALTIES ON CARDMEMBER BILLINGS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONVERSION     REVENUE, ROYALTIES ON CHARGE VOLUME AT MERCHANTS, SHARE OF     DISCOUNT REVENUE AND, IN SOME PARTNERSHIPS, ROYALTIES ON NET     SPREAD REVENUE OR ROYALTIES ON     CARDS-IN-FORCE.     OUR IO PARTNERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR TRANSACTION AUTHORIZATION,     BILLING AND PRICING, CARDMEMBER AND MERCHANT SERVICING, AND     FUNDING CARD RECEIVABLES FOR THEIR CARDS AND PAYABLES FOR THEIR     MERCHANTS.         WE BEAR THE CREDIT RISK ARISING FROM THE IO PARTNER\\x92S     POTENTIAL FAILURE TO MEET ITS SETTLEMENT OBLIGATIONS TO US. WE     MITIGATE THIS RISK BY PARTNERING WITH INSTITUTIONS THAT WE     BELIEVE ARE FINANCIALLY SOUND AND WILL MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS,     AND BY MONITORING THEIR FINANCIAL HEALTH, THEIR COMPLIANCE WITH     THE TERMS OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH US AND THE POLITICAL,     ECONOMIC AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THEY OPERATE. IN     ADDITION, DEPENDING ON AN IO PARTNER\\x92S CREDIT RATING AND     OTHER INDICATORS OF FINANCIAL HEALTH, WE MAY REQUIRE AN IO     PARTNER TO POST A LETTER OF CREDIT, BANK GUARANTEE OR OTHER     COLLATERAL TO REDUCE THIS RISK.         EXAMPLES OF COUNTRIES WHERE WE HAVE ENTERED INTO IO ARRANGEMENTS     INCLUDE BRAZIL, RUSSIA, CHINA, INDONESIA, TURKEY, ECUADOR,     GREECE, SOUTH KOREA, PAKISTAN, CROATIA, PERU, PORTUGAL AND     VIETNAM. THROUGH OUR IO PARTNERSHIPS, WE BELIEVE WE CAN     ACCELERATE GROWTH IN CARDMEMBER SPENDING,     CARDS-IN-FORCE     AND MERCHANT ACCEPTANCE IN THESE COUNTRIES.     NETWORK     CARD LICENSE ARRANGEMENTS         THE SECOND TYPE OF GNS ARRANGEMENT IS KNOWN AS A NETWORK CARD     LICENSE (\\x93NCL\\x94). AT THE END OF 2010, WE HAD 61 OF     THESE ARRANGEMENTS IN PLACE WORLDWIDE. WE PURSUE THESE     ARRANGEMENTS TO INCREASE OUR BRAND PRESENCE AND GAIN SHARE IN     COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE HAVE A PROPRIETARY CARD-ISSUING     AND/OR     MERCHANT ACQUIRING BUSINESS AND, IN A FEW CASES, THOSE IN WHICH     WE HAVE IO PARTNERS. IN AN NCL ARRANGEMENT, WE GRANT THE     THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTION A LICENSE TO ISSUE AMERICAN     EXPRESS-BRANDED CARDS. THE NCL ISSUER OWNS THE CUSTOMER     RELATIONSHIPS FOR ALL CARDS IT ISSUES, PROVIDES CUSTOMER SERVICE     TO ITS CARDMEMBERS, AUTHORIZES TRANSACTIONS, MANAGES BILLING AND     CREDIT, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MARKETING THE CARDS, AND DESIGNS CARD     PRODUCT FEATURES (INCLUDING REWARDS AND OTHER INCENTIVES FOR     CARDMEMBERS), SUBJECT TO MEETING CERTAIN STANDARDS. WE OPERATE     THE MERCHANT NETWORK, ROUTE AND PROCESS CARD TRANSACTIONS FROM     THE MERCHANT\\x92S     POINT-OF-SALE     THROUGH SUBMISSION TO THE ISSUER, AND SETTLE WITH ISSUERS. THE     NCL IS THE TYPE OF ARRANGEMENT WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED WITH BANKS IN     THE UNITED STATES, UNITED KINGDOM, AUSTRALIA AND JAPAN.         GNS\\x92 REVENUES IN NCL ARRANGEMENTS ARE DRIVEN BY A VARIETY     OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE LEVEL OF CARDMEMBER SPENDING,     ROYALTIES, CURRENCY CONVERSIONS AND LICENSING FEES PAID BY THE     PARTNER AND FEES CHARGED TO THE CARD ISSUER BASED ON CHARGE     VOLUME, AND OUR PROVISION OF VALUE-ADDED SERVICES SUCH AS     CARDMEMBER INSURANCE PRODUCTS AND OTHER CARD FEATURES AND     BENEFITS FOR THE ISSUER\\x92S CARDS. AS INDICATED ABOVE, THE     NCL ISSUER BEARS THE CREDIT RISK FOR THE ISSUED CARDS, AS WELL     AS THE CARD MARKETING AND ACQUISITION COSTS, CARDMEMBER FRAUD     RISKS AND COSTS OF REWARDS AND OTHER LOYALTY INITIATIVES. WE     BEAR THE RISK ARISING FROM THE NCL PARTNER\\x92S POTENTIAL     FAILURE TO MEET ITS SETTLEMENT OBLIGATIONS TO US. WE MITIGATE     THIS RISK BY PARTNERING WITH INSTITUTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE     FINANCIALLY SOUND AND WILL MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS, AND BY     MONITORING THEIR FINANCIAL HEALTH, THEIR COMPLIANCE WITH THE     TERMS OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH US AND THE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC     AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THEY OPERATE. IN ADDITION,     DEPENDING ON AN NCL ISSUER\\x92S CREDIT RATING AND          6    TABLE OF CONTENTS        OTHER INDICATORS OF FINANCIAL HEALTH, WE MAY REQUIRE AN NCL     ISSUER TO POST A LETTER OF CREDIT, BANK GUARANTEE OR OTHER     COLLATERAL TO REDUCE THIS RISK.         EXAMPLES OF NCL ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH BANK     OF AMERICA IN THE UNITED STATES, LLOYDS TSB BANK IN THE UNITED     KINGDOM AND WESTPAC BANKING CORPORATION IN AUSTRALIA.     JOINT     VENTURE ARRANGEMENTS         THE THIRD TYPE OF GNS ARRANGEMENT IS A JOINT VENTURE     (\\x93JV\\x94) ARRANGEMENT. WE HAVE UTILIZED THIS TYPE OF     ARRANGEMENT IN SWITZERLAND AND BELGIUM, AS WELL AS IN OTHER     COUNTRIES. IN THESE COUNTRIES, WE JOIN WITH A THIRD-PARTY TO     ESTABLISH A SEPARATE BUSINESS IN WHICH WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT     OWNERSHIP STAKE. THE JV TYPICALLY SIGNS NEW MERCHANTS TO THE     AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK AND ISSUES LOCAL CURRENCY CARDS THAT     CARRY OUR LOGO. IN A JV ARRANGEMENT, THE JV IS RESPONSIBLE FOR     THE CARDMEMBER CREDIT RISK AND BEARS THE OPERATING AND MARKETING     COSTS. UNLIKE THE OTHER TWO TYPES OF GNS ARRANGEMENTS, WE SHARE     MANAGEMENT, RISK, AND PROFIT AND LOSS RESPONSIBILITY WITH OUR JV     PARTNERS. INCOME IS GENERATED BY DISCOUNT REVENUES, CARD FEES     AND NET SPREAD REVENUES. THE ECONOMICS OF THE JV ARE SIMILAR TO     THOSE OF OUR PROPRIETARY CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS, WHICH WE DISCUSS     UNDER \\x93U.S. CARD SERVICES,\\x94 AND WE RECEIVE A     PORTION OF THE JV\\x92S INCOME DEPENDING ON, AMONG OTHER     THINGS, THE LEVEL OF OUR OWNERSHIP INTEREST. OUR SUBSIDIARY,     AEOCC LTD., PURCHASES CARD RECEIVABLES FROM CERTAIN OF THE GNS     JVS FROM TIME TO TIME.     GNS     BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS         OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES WE SIGNED A NUMBER OF AGREEMENTS IN     2010 TO ENHANCE OUR PRESENCE IN COUNTRIES WHERE WE ALREADY DO     BUSINESS AND FURTHER EXPANDED OUR GLOBAL PRESENCE INTO NEW     GEOGRAPHIC AREAS.         SOME OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF OUR GNS BUSINESS OUTSIDE THE UNITED     STATES IN 2010 INCLUDE:                 \\x95        ANNOUNCEMENT OF A NEW CARD PARTNERSHIP WITH SBERBANK, A LEADING     RETAIL BANK IN RUSSIA, FOR THE ISSUANCE OF AMERICAN EXPRESS     BRANDED-CARDS IN RUSSIA            \\x95        EXPANSION OF OUR CARD-ISSUING PARTNERSHIP WITH CHINA MERCHANTS     BANK THROUGH THE LAUNCH OF AMERICAN EXPRESS CONSUMER CARDS THAT     BEAR THE CENTURION IMAGE            \\x95        ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE LAUNCH OF THE PANTAI AMERICAN     EXPRESS®      CREDIT CARD WITH MAYBANK IN MALAYSIA, THE FIRST MEDICAL CO-BRAND     CREDIT CARD WITH A LEADING HEALTHCARE SERVICE PROVIDER IN     MALAYSIA            \\x95        RENEWAL BY CREDIT SAISON OF ITS SIGNATURE PRODUCT LINE IN JAPAN     AND INTRODUCTION OF FOUR NEW SAISON AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS WITH     THE CENTURION IMAGE            \\x95        LAUNCH OF THE BLUE FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD IN GEORGIA, WITH     OUR PARTNER, BANK OF GEORGIA            \\x95        LAUNCH OF THE BLUE FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD IN KAZAKHSTAN,     WITH OUR PARTNER, KAZKOMMERTSBANK            \\x95        LAUNCH OF THE AMERICAN     EXPRESS®      GOLD CARD IN ARMENIA, WITH OUR PARTNER, ACBA CREDIT AGRICOLE.

SOME OF     THE KEY AIRLINE CO-BRAND LAUNCHES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN     2010 INCLUDE:                 \\x95        HANA SK SKYPASS AMERICAN     EXPRESS®      CARD AND THE HANA SK SKYPASS CORPORATE AMERICAN     EXPRESS®      CARD WITH HANASK CARD CO., LTD.

GLOBAL     MERCHANT SERVICES         WE OPERATE A GMS BUSINESS, WHICH INCLUDES SIGNING MERCHANTS TO     ACCEPT CARDS, ACCEPTING AND PROCESSING CARD TRANSACTIONS, AND     SETTLING WITH MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT CARDS FOR PURCHASES MADE BY     CARDMEMBERS WITH CARDS (\\x93CHARGES\\x94). WE ALSO PROVIDE     MARKETING INFORMATION, AND OTHER PROGRAMS AND SERVICES TO     MERCHANTS, LEVERAGING THE CAPABILITIES PROVIDED BY OUR     INVESTMENTS IN OUR CLOSED-LOOP STRUCTURE, AS WELL AS     POINT-OF-SALE     PRODUCTS, SERVICING, AND FRAUD PREVENTION SERVICES.         OUR OBJECTIVE IS FOR CARDMEMBERS TO BE ABLE TO USE THE CARD     WHEREVER AND HOWEVER THEY DESIRE, AND TO INCREASE MERCHANT     COVERAGE IN KEY GEOGRAPHIC AREAS AND IN SELECTED NEW INDUSTRIES     THAT HAVE NOT TRADITIONALLY ACCEPTED THE CARD. WE ADD NEW     MERCHANTS TO OUR NETWORK THROUGH A NUMBER OF SALES CHANNELS: A     PROPRIETARY SALES FORCE, THIRD-PARTY SALES AND SERVICE AGENTS,     STRATEGIC ALLIANCES WITH BANKS AND PROCESSORS, THE INTERNET,     TELEMARKETING AND INBOUND \\x93WANT TO HONOR\\x94 CALLS (I.E.,     WHERE MERCHANTS DESIRING TO ACCEPT THE CARD CONTACT US     DIRECTLY). AS DISCUSSED IN THE \\x93GLOBAL NETWORK     SERVICES\\x94 SECTION, OUR IO PARTNERS AND JVS ALSO ADD NEW     LOCAL MERCHANTS TO THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK.         DURING 2010, WE CONTINUED EXPANDING OUR INTEGRATED AMERICAN     EXPRESS     ONEPOINT®      SOLUTION FOR SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZED MERCHANTS IN THE UNITED     STATES. UNDER THIS PROGRAM, THIRD-PARTY SERVICE AGENTS PROVIDE     PAYMENT PROCESSING SERVICES TO MERCHANTS ON OUR BEHALF FOR CARD     TRANSACTIONS, WHILE WE RETAIN THE ACCEPTANCE CONTRACT WITH     PARTICIPATING MERCHANTS, MANAGE MERCHANT PRICING DECISIONS AND     NEGOTIATIONS, AND RECEIVE THE SAME TRANSACTIONAL INFORMATION WE     ALWAYS HAVE RECEIVED THROUGH OUR CLOSED-LOOP NETWORK. THIS     PROGRAM SIMPLIFIES CARD PROCESSING FOR SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZED     MERCHANTS BY PROVIDING THEM WITH A SINGLE SOURCE FOR STATEMENTS,     SETTLEMENT AND CUSTOMER SERVICE. WE ARE NOW FOLLOWING A SIMILAR     STRATEGY TO OUR ONEPOINT SOLUTION IN SPAIN THROUGH OUR     ARRANGEMENT WITH LA CAIXA, ONE OF SPAIN\\x92S LARGEST     ACQUIRERS.         GMS CONTINUES TO SIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND THE NUMBER OF MERCHANTS     THAT ACCEPT OUR CARD PRODUCTS AS WELL AS THE KINDS OF BUSINESSES     THAT ACCEPT THE CARD. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE HAVE     FOCUSED OUR EFFORTS ON INCREASING THE USE OF OUR CARDS FOR     EVERYDAY SPENDING. IN 1990, 64% OF OUR U.S. BILLINGS CAME     FROM THE TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT SECTORS AND 36% CAME FROM     RETAIL AND OTHER SECTORS. THAT PROPORTION HAS NOW BEEN MORE THAN     REVERSED. IN 2010, U.S. NON-TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT     BILLINGS REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 71.5% OF THE U.S. BILLED     BUSINESS ON AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS. THIS SHIFT RESULTED, IN     PART, FROM THE GROWTH, OVER TIME, IN THE TYPES OF MERCHANTS THAT     BEGAN TO ACCEPT CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS IN RESPONSE TO     CONSUMERS\\x92 INCREASED DESIRE TO USE THESE CARDS FOR MORE OF     THEIR PURCHASES, OUR FOCUS ON EXPANDING CARD ACCEPTANCE TO MEET     CARDMEMBERS\\x92 NEEDS, AND INCREASED COMPETITION FROM OUR     COMPETITORS FOR TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT SECTOR SPENDING.         DURING 2010, WE CONTINUED OUR EFFORTS TO BRING CARD ACCEPTANCE     TO INDUSTRIES WHERE CASH OR CHECKS ARE THE PREDOMINANT FORM OF     PAYMENT. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE MADE HEADWAY IN PROMOTING CARD     ACCEPTANCE IN INDUSTRIES SUCH AS PHARMACEUTICALS, CONSTRUCTION,     INDUSTRIAL SUPPLY, INSURANCE AND ADVERTISING. CARD ACCEPTANCE     AGREEMENTS SIGNED IN 2010 IN THE UNITED STATES INCLUDE:                 \\x95        MERCURY INSURANCE GROUP, A LEADING INSURANCE COMPANY            \\x95        BDO USA, LLP, A LEADING PROFESSIONAL SERVICES FIRM PROVIDING     ASSURANCE, TAX, FINANCIAL ADVISORY AND CONSULTING SERVICES            \\x95        APPLIED MEDICAL, A GLOBAL MEDICAL DEVICE COMPANY THAT DEVELOPS,     MANUFACTURES AND MARKETS MEDICAL DEVICES USED IN SURGICAL     PROCEDURES.           8    TABLE OF CONTENTS          INTERNATIONALLY, AMONG OTHERS, CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENTS WERE     REACHED WITH:                 \\x95        CENTRO DE RECAUDACIONES DE IMPUESTOS MUNICIPALES (CRIM), THE TAX     COLLECTIONS GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY IN PUERTO RICO & THE     CARIBBEAN            \\x95        MUNICIPIO DE NAUCALPAN IN MEXICO            \\x95        AAMI, ONE OF AUSTRALIA\\x92S LARGEST AND HIGHEST PROFILE     GENERAL INSURANCE COMPANIES            \\x95        AGEAS INSURANCE SOLUTIONS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.           ADDITIONALLY, WE CONTINUED OUR DRIVE TO EXPAND CARD ACCEPTANCE     FOR RETAIL AND EVERYDAY SPENDING CATEGORIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED     STATES. FOR EXAMPLE, DURING 2010, WE ANNOUNCED CARD ACCEPTANCE     AGREEMENTS WITH:                 \\x95        SEVEN ELEVEN, NOW ACCEPTING THE CARD IN MEXICO            \\x95        BEST BUY, NOW ACCEPTING THE CARD IN THE UNITED KINGDOM            \\x95        KAISER\\x92S TENGELMANN AG, NOW AN ACCEPTING SUPERMARKET     MERCHANT IN GERMANY.           GLOBALLY, ACCEPTANCE OF GENERAL-PURPOSE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS     CONTINUES TO INCREASE. AS IN PRIOR YEARS, DURING 2010, WE     CONTINUED TO GROW MERCHANT ACCEPTANCE OF CARDS AROUND THE WORLD     AND TO REFINE OUR APPROACH TO CALCULATING MERCHANT COVERAGE IN     ACCORDANCE WITH CHANGES IN THE MARKETPLACE. MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES     THAT, AS OF THE END OF 2010, OUR MERCHANT NETWORK IN THE UNITED     STATES ACCOMMODATED MORE THAN 90% OF OUR CARDMEMBERS\\x92     GENERAL-PURPOSE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD SPENDING, AND OUR     INTERNATIONAL MERCHANT NETWORK AS A WHOLE ACCOMMODATED     APPROXIMATELY 80% OF OUR CARDMEMBERS\\x92 GENERAL-PURPOSE     CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD SPENDING. THESE PERCENTAGES ARE BASED ON     COMPARING OUR CARDMEMBERS\\x92 SPENDING ON OUR NETWORK     CURRENTLY WITH OUR ESTIMATE OF WHAT OUR CARDMEMBERS WOULD SPEND     ON OUR NETWORK IF ALL MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT GENERAL-PURPOSE     CREDIT AND CHARGE CARDS ACCEPTED AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS.         WE EARN \\x93DISCOUNT\\x94 REVENUE FROM FEES CHARGED TO     MERCHANTS FOR ACCEPTING CARDS AS PAYMENT FOR GOODS OR SERVICES     SOLD. THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT IS THE FEE CHARGED TO THE MERCHANT     FOR ACCEPTING CARDS AND IS GENERALLY EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE     OF THE AMOUNT CHARGED ON A CARD. IN SOME INSTANCES, AN     ADDITIONAL FLAT TRANSACTION FEE IS ASSESSED. THE MERCHANT     DISCOUNT IS GENERALLY DEDUCTED FROM THE AMOUNT OF THE PAYMENT     THAT THE \\x93MERCHANT ACQUIRER\\x94 (IN MOST CASES, INCLUDING     FOR ALL U.S. MERCHANTS, TRS OR ONE OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES)     PAYS TO A MERCHANT FOR CHARGES SUBMITTED. A MERCHANT ACQUIRER IS     THE ENTITY THAT CONTRACTS FOR CARD ACCEPTANCE WITH THE MERCHANT,     ACCEPTS TRANSACTIONS FROM THE MERCHANT, PAYS THE MERCHANT FOR     THESE TRANSACTIONS AND SUBMITS THE TRANSACTIONS TO THE AMERICAN     EXPRESS NETWORK, WHICH SUBMITS THE TRANSACTIONS TO THE     APPROPRIATE CARD ISSUER. WHEN A CARDMEMBER PRESENTS THE CARD FOR     PAYMENT, THE MERCHANT CREATES A RECORD OF CHARGE FOR THE     TRANSACTION AND SUBMITS IT TO THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER FOR PAYMENT.     TO THE EXTENT THAT TRS OR ONE OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES IS THE     MERCHANT ACQUIRER, THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT IS RECORDED BY US AS     DISCOUNT REVENUE AT THE TIME THE TRANSACTION IS RECEIVED BY US     FROM THE MERCHANT.         WHERE WE ACT AS THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER AND THE CARD PRESENTED AT     A MERCHANT IS ISSUED BY A THIRD-PARTY BANK OR FINANCIAL     INSTITUTION, SUCH AS IN THE CASE OF OUR GNS PARTNERS, WE WILL     MAKE FINANCIAL SETTLEMENT TO THE MERCHANT AND RECEIVE THE     DISCOUNT REVENUE. IN OUR ROLE AS THE OPERATOR OF THE CARD     NETWORK, WE WILL ALSO RECEIVE FINANCIAL SETTLEMENT FROM THE CARD     ISSUER, WHO RECEIVES AN ISSUER RATE (I.E., THE INDIVIDUALLY     NEGOTIATED AMOUNT THAT CARD ISSUERS RECEIVE FOR TRANSACTIONS     CHARGED ON OUR NETWORK WITH CARDS THEY ISSUE, WHICH IS USUALLY     EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE CHARGED AMOUNT). THE DIFFERENCE     BETWEEN THE DISCOUNT REVENUE (RECEIVED BY US IN THE FORM OF THE     MERCHANT DISCOUNT) AND THE ISSUER RATE RECEIVED BY THE CARD     ISSUER GENERATES A RETURN TO US. IN CASES WHERE AMERICAN EXPRESS     IS THE CARD ISSUER AND THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER IS A THIRD-PARTY     BANK OR FINANCIAL INSTITUTION (WHICH CAN BE THE CASE IN A     COUNTRY IN WHICH THE IO IS THE LOCAL MERCHANT ACQUIRER), WE     RECEIVE AN INDIVIDUALLY NEGOTIATED ISSUER RATE IN OUR SETTLEMENT     WITH THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER, WHICH IS RECORDED BY US AS DISCOUNT     REVENUE. BY CONTRAST WITH NETWORKS SUCH AS VISA AND MASTERCARD,     THERE IS NO COLLECTIVELY SET INTERCHANGE RATE ON THE AMERICAN     EXPRESS NETWORK.         9    TABLE OF CONTENTS        THE FOLLOWING DIAGRAMS DEPICT THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THE     PARTIES IN A     POINT-OF-SALE     TRANSACTION EFFECTED ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK WHERE WE     ACT AS BOTH THE CARD ISSUER AND MERCHANT ACQUIRER (THE     \\x933-PARTY MODEL\\x94) AND UNDER AN NCL ARRANGEMENT WHERE     THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ACT AS CARD ISSUERS (THE     \\x93NCL MODEL\\x94):              THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT WE CHARGE REFLECTS THE VALUE WE DELIVER TO     THE MERCHANT AND GENERALLY REPRESENTS A PREMIUM OVER THE RATES     CHARGED FOR ACCEPTANCE OF MANY CARDS ISSUED ON OTHER NETWORKS.     WE DELIVER GREATER VALUE TO MERCHANTS IN A VARIETY OF WAYS,     INCLUDING THROUGH HIGHER SPENDING BY OUR CARDMEMBERS RELATIVE TO     USERS OF CARDS ISSUED ON COMPETING CARD NETWORKS, OUR PRODUCT     AND NETWORK FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY, OUR MARKETING EXPERTISE     AND PROGRAMS, INFORMATION SERVICES, FRAUD PREVENTION SERVICES,     AND OTHER INVESTMENTS WHICH ENHANCE THE MERCHANT VALUE     PROPOSITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH ACCEPTANCE OF THE CARD.         THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT VARIES, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, WITH THE     INDUSTRY IN WHICH THE MERCHANT DOES BUSINESS, THE     MERCHANT\\x92S CHARGE VOLUME, THE TIMING AND METHOD OF PAYMENT     TO THE MERCHANT, THE METHOD OF SUBMISSION OF CHARGES AND, IN     CERTAIN INSTANCES, THE GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE OF THE CARD ACCEPTANCE     AGREEMENT SIGNED WITH US (LOCAL OR GLOBAL) AND THE CHARGE AMOUNT.         IN PRIOR YEARS, WE EXPERIENCED SOME REDUCTION IN OUR GLOBAL     WEIGHTED AVERAGE MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE. THE AVERAGE DISCOUNT     RATE WAS 2.55 PERCENT AND 2.54 PERCENT FOR 2010 AND     2009, RESPECTIVELY. OVER TIME, CERTAIN REPRICING INITIATIVES,     CHANGES IN THE MIX OF BUSINESS AND VOLUME-RELATED PRICING     DISCOUNTS AND INVESTMENTS WILL LIKELY RESULT IN SOME EROSION OF     THE AVERAGE DISCOUNT RATE.         WHILE MOST MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT OUR CARDS UNDERSTAND OUR     MERCHANT DISCOUNT PRICING IN RELATION TO THE VALUE PROVIDED, WE     DO ENCOUNTER A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT     OUR CARDS, BUT TELL THEIR CUSTOMERS THAT THEY PREFER TO ACCEPT     ANOTHER TYPE OF PAYMENT OR OTHERWISE SEEK TO SUPPRESS USE OF THE     CARD. SUBJECT TO LOCAL LEGAL REQUIREMENTS (SUCH AS, BY WAY OF     EXAMPLE, DODD-FRANK), WE RESPOND TO THIS ISSUE VIGOROUSLY TO     ENSURE THAT OUR CARDMEMBERS ARE ABLE TO USE THEIR CARD WHERE AND     WHEN THEY WANT TO AND TO PROTECT THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND. WE     HAVE MADE PROGRESS LIMITING CARD SUPPRESSION BY FOCUSING ON     ACQUIRING MERCHANTS WHERE CARDMEMBERS WANT TO USE THE CARD;     CONTINUING TO ENHANCE THE VALUE WE PROVIDE TO MERCHANTS THROUGH     PROGRAMS SUCH AS DAILYWISH AND AMERICAN EXPRESS SELECTS, WHICH     ENABLE MERCHANTS OF          10    TABLE OF CONTENTS        ANY SIZE TO GAIN VALUABLE EXPOSURE AND ADDITIONAL SALES BY     PROVIDING EXCLUSIVE OFFERS AND EXPERIENCES TO AMERICAN EXPRESS     CARDMEMBERS; DEVELOPING AND PROVIDING NEW AND INNOVATIVE     BUSINESS INSIGHTS, MARKETING PROGRAMS AND FRAUD PREVENTION TOOLS     USING INFORMATION AVAILABLE THROUGH OUR CLOSED-LOOP NETWORK;     PROVIDING BETTER AND EARLIER COMMUNICATION OF OUR VALUE     PROPOSITION; AND, WHEN APPROPRIATE, EXERCISING OUR RIGHT TO     TERMINATE CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENTS WITH MERCHANTS WHO SEEK TO     SUPPRESS THE USE OF OUR CARD PRODUCTS. WE HAVE A CLIENT     MANAGEMENT ORGANIZATION WHICH IS DEDICATED TO GROWING OUR     MERCHANT CUSTOMERS\\x92 BUSINESS AND FINDING WAYS TO ENHANCE     EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THESE KEY BUSINESS     PARTNERS. MOST IMPORTANTLY, WE RECOGNIZE THAT IT IS THE     MERCHANT\\x92S CHOICE WHETHER OR NOT TO ACCEPT AMERICAN EXPRESS     CARDS AND THAT ALL MERCHANTS HAVE NUMEROUS OPTIONS GIVEN THE     INTENSE COMPETITION FROM NEW AND TRADITIONAL FORMS OF PAYMENT.     THEREFORE, WE DEDICATE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO DELIVERING     SUPERIOR AND DIFFERENTIATED VALUE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN OUR     MERCHANT CUSTOMERS.         THE LAWS OF A NUMBER OF STATES IN THE U.S. AND CERTAIN     COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE U.S. PROHIBIT SURCHARGING CREDIT CARD     PURCHASES. AMERICAN EXPRESS\\x92 CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENTS     WITH MERCHANTS GENERALLY DO NOT PROHIBIT SURCHARGING SO LONG AS     IT IS PERMITTED BY LAW AND A MERCHANT DOES NOT DISCRIMINATE     AGAINST THE CARD BY SURCHARGING HIGHER AMOUNTS ON PURCHASES WITH     THE CARD THAN ON PURCHASES WITH OTHER CARDS, OR BY IMPOSING A     SURCHARGE ONLY ON CARD PURCHASES, BUT NOT ON PURCHASES MADE WITH     OTHER CARDS. AMERICAN EXPRESS ALSO DOES NOT PROHIBIT MERCHANTS     FROM OFFERING DISCOUNTS TO CUSTOMERS WHO PAY WITH CASH, CHECK OR     AUTOMATED CLEARING HOUSE (I.E., INTER-BANK TRANSFERS OR     \\x93ACH\\x94). IN ADDITION, AMERICAN EXPRESS DOES NOT     PROHIBIT U.S. MERCHANTS FROM OFFERING DISCOUNTS OR IN-KIND     INCENTIVES TO CUSTOMERS WHO PAY WITH PARTICULAR FORMS OF PAYMENT     IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF DODD-FRANK, WHICH WAS     ENACTED IN JULY 2010. FOR INFORMATION CONCERNING THE PROCEEDING     AGAINST US RECENTLY BROUGHT BY THE DOJ AND CERTAIN STATE     ATTORNEYS GENERAL ALLEGING VIOLATION OF THE U.S. ANTITRUST     LAWS WITH REGARD TO CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF OUR MERCHANT     AGREEMENTS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO PROTECT OUR CARDMEMBERS AND OUR     BRAND AGAINST DISCRIMINATION AT THE POINT OF SALE, PLEASE SEE     \\x93CORPORATE MATTERS\\x94 WITHIN \\x93LEGAL     PROCEEDINGS\\x94 BEGINNING ON PAGE 91.         GMS IS FOCUSED ON UNDERSTANDING AND ADDRESSING FACTORS THAT     INFLUENCE MERCHANT SATISFACTION, INCLUDING DEVELOPING AND     EXECUTING INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS THAT INCREASE CARD USAGE AT     MERCHANTS, USING TECHNOLOGY RESOURCES, ENHANCING OPERATIONAL     EFFICIENCIES AND MERCHANTS\\x92 EASE OF DOING BUSINESS WITH US,     PROVIDING A SUITE OF ONLINE SERVICING TOOLS, MAKING OUR UNITED     STATES OPERATING PROCEDURES EASILY AVAILABLE TO MERCHANTS ON OUR     WEB SITE, APPLYING OUR CLOSED-LOOP CAPABILITIES AND DEEP     MARKETING EXPERTISE, AND STRENGTHENING OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH     MERCHANTS THROUGH AN EXPANDING ROSTER OF SERVICES THAT HELPS     THEM MEET THEIR BUSINESS GOALS.         WE ALSO OFFER OUR MERCHANT CUSTOMERS A FULL RANGE OF     POINT-OF-SALE     SOLUTIONS, INCLUDING INTEGRATED     POINT-OF-SALE     TERMINALS, SOFTWARE, ONLINE SOLUTIONS, AND DIRECT LINKS THAT     ALLOW MERCHANTS TO ACCEPT AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS (AS WELL AS     CREDIT AND DEBIT CARDS ISSUED ON OTHER NETWORKS AND CHECKS).     VIRTUALLY ALL PROPRIETARY     POINT-OF-SALE     SOLUTIONS SUPPORT DIRECT PROCESSING (I.E., DIRECT CONNECTIVITY)     TO AMERICAN EXPRESS, WHICH CAN LOWER A MERCHANT\\x92S COST OF     CARD ACCEPTANCE AND ENHANCE PAYMENT EFFICIENCY.         IN NOVEMBER 2010, WE ACQUIRED ACCERTIFY INC., A LEADING PROVIDER     OF SOLUTIONS THAT HELP MERCHANTS COMBAT FRAUDULENT ONLINE AND     OTHER CARD-NOT-PRESENT TRANSACTIONS. LAUNCHED IN 2007, ACCERTIFY     PROVIDES A HOSTED SOFTWARE APPLICATION THAT OFFERS AN EXTRA     LEVEL OF SECURITY FOR TRANSACTIONS OVER ANY OF THE MAJOR PAYMENT     NETWORKS, INCLUDING AMERICAN EXPRESS, VISA, MASTERCARD, DISCOVER     AND PAYPAL, OR ANY OTHER ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT METHOD. ACCERTIFY     ALSO OFFERS MERCHANTS THE OPTION TO OUTSOURCE THEIR     END-TO-END     FRAUD MANAGEMENT PROCESS. WITH THE ACQUISITION OF ACCERTIFY,     AMERICAN EXPRESS IS ABLE TO BROADEN ITS FRAUD PREVENTION     SERVICES TO MERCHANTS FOR TRANSACTIONS THAT TAKE PLACE ON ALL     NETWORKS. ACCERTIFY\\x92S CAPABILITIES ARE INCREMENTAL AND     COMPLEMENTARY TO AMERICAN EXPRESS\\x92 FRAUD SOLUTIONS ALREADY     OFFERED TO MERCHANTS FOR TRANSACTIONS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS     NETWORK.         IN NOVEMBER 2010, WE ALSO ANNOUNCED THE LAUNCH OF AMERICAN     EXPRESS     SAFEKEYSM,      AN ONLINE FRAUD PREVENTION SOLUTION, WHICH LICENSES VISA\\x92S     3-D SECURE     PROTOCOL, A TECHNOLOGY EMBRACED BY THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY AS A     GLOBAL STANDARD FOR PAYMENT AUTHENTICATION.         WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS OUR COMMITMENT TO DRIVING GLOBAL     INTEROPERABILITY IN PAYMENT CARD SPECIFICATIONS, MAKING IT     EASIER FOR MERCHANTS TO ACCEPT OUR CARDS, FOR CARDMEMBERS TO     HAVE A MORE SEAMLESS EXPERIENCE AT          11    TABLE OF CONTENTS        THE POINT OF SALE, AND FOR ISSUERS WHO HAVE MORE THAN ONE     NETWORK RELATIONSHIP TO HAVE A STANDARD ACROSS THEIR CARD     PRODUCTS.         WE ARE AN OWNER-MEMBER OF EMVCO, THE STANDARDS BODY THAT     MANAGES, MAINTAINS, AND ENHANCES SPECIFICATIONS FOR CHIP-BASED     PAYMENT CARDS AND ACCEPTANCE DEVICES, INCLUDING     POINT-OF-SALE     TERMINALS. OUR PARTICIPATION IN THIS COMPANY HELPS TO DRIVE     SECURE AND INTEROPERABLE PAYMENTS GLOBALLY FOR TRANSACTIONS MADE     WITH CHIP CARDS BY ALIGNING AND PROGRESSING THE EMV     SPECIFICATIONS. FURTHER, AS EMVCO\\x92S SCOPE EXPANDS TO     INCLUDE EMERGING PAYMENT TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS CONTACTLESS CARDS     AND MOBILE PHONES, OUR PARTICIPATION WILL FACILITATE OUR     PRODUCTS AND SPECIFICATIONS BEING UNIVERSALLY COMPATIBLE AND     READY FOR MERCHANT ACCEPTANCE.         WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS OUR EFFORTS IN AREAS THAT MAKE USE AND     ACCEPTANCE OF THE CARD MORE CONVENIENT FOR MERCHANTS AND     CARDMEMBERS. FOR INSTANCE, AMERICAN EXPRESS OFFERS A CONTACTLESS     PAYMENT FEATURE EMBEDDED IN CERTAIN CARDS, TO PROVIDE A FAST,     EASY-TO-USE ALTERNATIVE TO CASH, CHECK, DEBIT OR OTHER PAYMENT     FORMS, PARTICULARLY FOR MAKING EVERYDAY PURCHASES AT MERCHANTS     WHERE SPEED AND CONVENIENCE IS IMPORTANT. IN THE U.S., TOP     QUICK-SERVICE RESTAURANTS, MOVIE THEATERS, DRUG AND CONVENIENCE     STORES AND MAJOR RETAIL CHAINS READILY ACCEPT AMERICAN EXPRESS     CONTACTLESS PAYMENTS. SIMILARLY, AUTOMATIC BILL PAYMENT FOCUSES     ON PROVIDING CONVENIENCE BY ALLOWING MERCHANTS TO BILL     CARDMEMBERS ON A REGULAR BASIS FOR RECURRING CHARGES APPROVED BY     THE CARDMEMBER SUCH AS INSURANCE PREMIUMS, NEWSPAPER     SUBSCRIPTIONS, HEALTH CLUB MEMBERSHIPS, COMMUTATION COSTS AND     TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICES. ADDITIONALLY, TO PROVIDE EXTRA     CONVENIENCE AND SPEED AT THE POINT OF SALE, LOW VALUE     TRANSACTIONS (UNDER $25 IN THE U.S.) DO NOT REQUIRE A SIGNATURE.         WHEREVER WE MANAGE BOTH THE ACQUIRING RELATIONSHIP WITH     MERCHANTS AND THE CARD-ISSUING SIDE OF THE BUSINESS, THERE IS A     \\x93CLOSED-LOOP,\\x94 WHICH DISTINGUISHES OUR NETWORK FROM     THE BANKCARD NETWORKS, IN THAT WE HAVE ACCESS TO INFORMATION AT     BOTH ENDS OF THE CARD TRANSACTION. WE MAINTAIN DIRECT     RELATIONSHIPS WITH BOTH OUR CARDMEMBERS AND OUR MERCHANTS, AND     WE HANDLE ALL KEY ASPECTS OF THOSE RELATIONSHIPS.         OUR RELATIONSHIPS ALLOW US TO ANALYZE INFORMATION ON CARDMEMBER     SPENDING. THIS ENABLES US TO PROVIDE TARGETED MARKETING AND     OTHER INFORMATION SERVICES FOR MERCHANTS AND SPECIAL OFFERS AND     SERVICES TO CARDMEMBERS THROUGH A VARIETY OF CHANNELS. RECENTLY,     WE CREATED A BUSINESS WITHIN GMS CALLED AMERICAN     EXPRESS®      BUSINESS INSIGHTS, WHICH OFFERS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES DERIVED     FROM OUR STRONG BUSINESS MODEL AND CLOSED LOOP NETWORK. BUSINESS     INSIGHTS COMBINES AGGREGATED, NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE DATA     AND TREND ANALYSIS TO PROVIDE SPECIALIZED BUSINESS PLANNING AND     MARKETING EXPERTISE TO OUR CUSTOMERS. AT THE SAME TIME, WE     PROTECT THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF INFORMATION ON CARDMEMBER     SPENDING, AND COMPLY WITH OUR PRIVACY AND FIREWALL POLICIES AND     APPLICABLE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS.         WE WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR CARD-ISSUING AND MERCHANT-ACQUIRING     BANK PARTNERS TO MAINTAIN KEY ELEMENTS OF THIS CLOSED-LOOP,     WHICH PERMITS THEM TO CUSTOMIZE MARKETING EFFORTS, DELIVER     GREATER VALUE TO THEIR CARDMEMBERS AND HELP US TO DIRECT     INCREASED BUSINESS TO MERCHANTS WHO ACCEPT THE CARD.         AS THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER, WE HAVE CERTAIN EXPOSURES THAT ARISE     IF A BILLING DISPUTE BETWEEN A CARDMEMBER AND A MERCHANT IS     SETTLED IN FAVOR OF THE CARDMEMBER. DRIVERS OF THIS LIABILITY     ARE RETURNS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, DISPUTES OVER     FRAUDULENT CHARGES, THE QUALITY OR NON-DELIVERY OF GOODS AND     SERVICES AND BILLING ERRORS. TYPICALLY, WE OFFSET THE AMOUNT DUE     TO THE CARDMEMBER AGAINST PAYMENTS FOR THE MERCHANT\\x92S     CURRENT OR FUTURE CHARGE SUBMISSIONS. WE CAN REALIZE LOSSES WHEN     A MERCHANT\\x92S OFFSETTING CHARGE SUBMISSIONS CEASE, SUCH AS     WHEN THE MERCHANT DECIDES TO NO LONGER ACCEPT THE CARD,     COMMENCES A BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING OR GOES OUT OF BUSINESS. WE     ACTIVELY MONITOR OUR MERCHANT BASE TO ASSESS THE RISK OF THIS     EXPOSURE. WHEN APPROPRIATE, WE WILL TAKE ACTION TO REDUCE THE     NET EXPOSURE TO A GIVEN MERCHANT BY HOLDING CASH RESERVES FUNDED     THROUGH CHARGE PAYABLE HOLDBACKS FROM A MERCHANT, LENGTHENING     THE TIME BETWEEN WHEN THE MERCHANT SUBMITS A CHARGE FOR PAYMENT     AND WHEN WE PAY THE MERCHANT REQUIRING THE MERCHANT TO SECURE A     LETTER OF CREDIT OR A PARENT COMPANY GUARANTEE, OR IMPLEMENTING     OTHER APPROPRIATE RISK MANAGEMENT TOOLS. WE ALSO ESTABLISH     RESERVES ON OUR BALANCE SHEET FOR THESE CONTINGENCIES IN     ACCORDANCE WITH RELEVANT ACCOUNTING RULES.         WITH THE INCREASE IN ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION OF PAYMENT CARD     TRANSACTION DATA OVER MERCHANTS\\x92     POINT-OF-SALE     SYSTEMS, AMERICAN EXPRESS AND OTHER CARD NETWORKS RECOGNIZED THE     NECESSITY FOR MERCHANTS AND MERCHANT PROCESSORS TO SECURE THIS     DATA AGAINST ACCIDENTAL OR INTENTIONAL COMPROMISE USING A     STANDARD PROTOCOL THAT APPLIES TO ALL CARD TYPES. WE AND     DISCOVER FINANCIAL SERVICES, JCB CO., LTD., MASTERCARD WORLDWIDE     AND          12    TABLE OF CONTENTS        VISA FORMED PCI SECURITY STANDARDS COUNCIL, LLC (\\x93PCI     SSC\\x94), AN INDEPENDENT STANDARDS-SETTING ORGANIZATION. PCI     SSC\\x92S ROLE IS TO MANAGE THE PAYMENT CARD INDUSTRY     (\\x93PCI\\x94) DATA SECURITY STANDARD, AND MORE RECENTLY THE     PCI PIN ENTRY DEVICE (\\x93PED\\x94) SECURITY REQUIREMENTS AND     THE PAYMENT APPLICATION DATA SECURITY STANDARD, WHICH FOCUS ON     IMPROVING PAYMENT CARD ACCOUNT SECURITY THROUGHOUT THE     TRANSACTION PROCESS. BY ESTABLISHING PCI SSC, WE AND THE OTHER     FOUNDERS HAVE DEVELOPED COMMON STANDARDS THAT ARE MORE     ACCESSIBLE AND EFFICIENT FOR PARTICIPANTS IN THE PAYMENT CARD     INDUSTRY. ALL OUR MERCHANTS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT STORE,     PROCESS AND TRANSMIT PAYMENT CARD DATA ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLY     WITH THE PCI DATA SECURITY STANDARD. PCI SSC IS DEDICATED TO     DRIVING GREATER EDUCATION, AWARENESS AND ADOPTION OF THESE     SECURITY STANDARDS TO ENSURE THAT ALL STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED IN     THE PAYMENT PROCESS CONDUCT THEIR BUSINESS RESPONSIBLY.         IN SOME MARKETS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, PARTICULARLY IN ASIA,     THIRD-PARTY PROCESSORS AND SOME BANKCARD ACQUIRERS OFFER     MERCHANTS THE CAPABILITY OF CONVERTING CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS     FROM THE LOCAL CURRENCY TO THE CURRENCY OF THE CARDHOLDER\\x92S     RESIDENCE (I.E., THE CARDHOLDER\\x92S BILLING CURRENCY) AT THE     POINT-OF-SALE,     AND SUBMITTING THE TRANSACTION IN THE CARDHOLDER\\x92S BILLING     CURRENCY, THUS BYPASSING THE TRADITIONAL FOREIGN CURRENCY     CONVERSION PROCESS OF THE CARD NETWORK. THIS PRACTICE IS KNOWN     AS \\x93DYNAMIC CURRENCY CONVERSION.\\x94 IF A MERCHANT     UTILIZES A DYNAMIC CURRENCY CONVERSION PROCESS, THE MERCHANT AND     PROCESSOR SHARE ANY FEE ASSESSED OR SPREAD EARNED FOR CONVERTING     THE TRANSACTION AT THE     POINT-OF-SALE,     THUS REDUCING OR ELIMINATING REVENUE FOR CARD ISSUERS AND CARD     NETWORKS RELATING TO THE CONVERSION OF FOREIGN CHARGES TO THE     CARDHOLDER\\x92S BILLING CURRENCY. THIS PRACTICE IS STILL NOT     WIDESPREAD, AND IT REMAINS UNCERTAIN WHETHER ITS USE WILL EXPAND     OVER TIME. OUR POLICY GENERALLY REQUIRES MERCHANTS TO SUBMIT     CHARGES AND BE PAID IN THE CURRENCY OF THE COUNTRY IN WHICH THE     TRANSACTION OCCURS, AND WE CONVERT THE TRANSACTION TO THE     CARDMEMBER\\x92S BILLING CURRENCY.     GLOBAL     NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICES \\x97     COMPETITION         OUR GLOBAL CARD NETWORK, INCLUDING OUR GLOBAL MERCHANT SERVICES     AND GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES BUSINESSES, COMPETES IN THE GLOBAL     PAYMENTS INDUSTRY WITH OTHER CARD NETWORKS, INCLUDING, AMONG     OTHERS, VISA, MASTERCARD, DINERS CLUB INTERNATIONAL (WHICH WAS     ACQUIRED BY DISCOVER FINANCIAL SERVICES), AND DISCOVER     (PRIMARILY IN THE UNITED STATES). WE ARE THE THIRD LARGEST     GENERAL-PURPOSE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD NETWORK BASED ON CHARGE     VOLUME, BEHIND VISA AND MASTERCARD, WHICH WE BELIEVE ARE LARGER     THAN WE ARE IN MOST COUNTRIES. IN ADDITION, APART FROM SUCH     NETWORK SERVICES, A RANGE OF COMPANIES GLOBALLY, INCLUDING     MERCHANT ACQUIRERS AND PROCESSORS, CARRY OUT SOME ACTIVITIES     SIMILAR TO THOSE PERFORMED BY OUR GMS AND GNS BUSINESSES. NO     SINGLE ENTITY PARTICIPATES ON A GLOBAL BASIS IN THE FULL RANGE     OF ACTIVITIES THAT ARE ENCOMPASSED BY OUR CLOSED-LOOP BUSINESS     MODEL.         THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE NETWORK AND     MERCHANT SERVICE BUSINESSES INCLUDE:                 \\x95        THE NUMBER OF     CARDS-IN-FORCE     AND AMOUNT OF SPENDING ON THESE CARDS            \\x95        THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF THE ESTABLISHMENTS WHERE THE CARDS     CAN BE USED            \\x95        THE ECONOMIC ATTRACTIVENESS TO CARD ISSUERS AND MERCHANTS OF     PARTICIPATING IN THE NETWORK            \\x95        THE SUCCESS OF MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGNS            \\x95        REPUTATION AND BRAND RECOGNITION            \\x95        INNOVATION AND INVESTMENT IN SYSTEMS, TECHNOLOGY, PRODUCT AND     SERVICE OFFERINGS, PARTICULARLY IN ON-LINE COMMERCE            \\x95        THE QUALITY OF CUSTOMER SERVICE            \\x95        THE SECURITY OF CARDMEMBER AND MERCHANT INFORMATION            \\x95        THE IMPACT OF EXISTING LITIGATION, LEGISLATION AND GOVERNMENT     REGULATION            \\x95        THE COST OF CARD ACCEPTANCE RELATIVE TO THE VALUE PROVIDED.           ANOTHER ASPECT OF NETWORK COMPETITION IS THE RECENT EMERGENCE     AND RAPID GROWTH OF ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MECHANISMS AND SYSTEMS,     WHICH INCLUDE AGGREGATORS (SUCH AS PAYPAL), WIRELESS PAYMENT     TECHNOLOGIES          13    TABLE OF CONTENTS        (INCLUDING USING MOBILE TELEPHONE NETWORKS TO CARRY OUT     TRANSACTIONS), PREPAID SYSTEMS AND SYSTEMS LINKED TO PAYMENT     CARDS, AND BANK TRANSFER MODELS.         NEW TECHNOLOGIES, TOGETHER WITH THE PORTABILITY PROVIDED BY     SMARTPHONES AND TABLETS AND EVOLVING CONSUMER BEHAVIOR WITH     SOCIAL NETWORKING, ARE RAPIDLY CHANGING THE WAY PEOPLE INTERACT     WITH EACH OTHER AND TRANSACT BUSINESS ALL AROUND THE WORLD. IN     THIS CONNECTION, TRADITIONAL AND NON-TRADITIONAL COMPETITORS     SUCH AS MOBILE TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES ARE WORKING TO     DELIVER DIGITAL AND MOBILE PAYMENT SERVICES FOR BOTH CONSUMERS     AND MERCHANTS. WHILE WE ESTIMATE THAT WE HAVE THE LARGEST SHARE     OF ONLINE SPENDING OF ANY MAJOR CARD ISSUER AND MORE GLOBAL     ONLINE BILLINGS VOLUME THAN PAYPAL, THE COMPETITION REMAINS     FIERCE FOR CAPTURING ONLINE SPEND IN THE EVER-INCREASING DIGITAL     WORLD.         TO THE EXTENT ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MECHANISMS AND SYSTEMS, SUCH     AS AGGREGATORS, CONTINUE TO SUCCESSFULLY EXPAND, DISCOUNT     REVENUES AND OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS TRANSACTION DATA THROUGH OUR     CLOSED-LOOP NETWORK, AND POTENTIALLY OTHER REVENUES COULD BE     NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. IN THE UNITED STATES, ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT     VEHICLES THAT SEEK TO REDIRECT CUSTOMERS TO PAYMENT SYSTEMS     BASED ON ACH CONTINUE TO EMERGE AND GROW, AND EXISTING DEBIT     NETWORKS ALSO CONTINUE TO EXPAND BOTH ON- AND OFF-LINE AND ARE     MAKING EFFORTS TO DEVELOP ONLINE PIN FUNCTIONALITY, WHICH COULD     FURTHER REDUCE THE RELATIVE USE OF CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS     ONLINE. FOR A DISCUSSION CONCERNING OUR INVOLVEMENT IN THE     EMERGING PAYMENTS AREA, PLEASE SEE \\x93ENTERPRISE GROWTH\\x94     BEGINNING ON PAGE 34 BELOW.         SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS HAVE ATTEMPTED TO REPLICATE OUR     CLOSED-LOOP FUNCTIONALITY, SUCH AS VISA, WITH ITS VISA INCENTIVE     NETWORK. ALTHOUGH IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN HOW EFFECTIVE VISA WILL     BE, EFFORTS BY VISA AND OTHER CARD NETWORKS AND PAYMENT     PROVIDERS TO REPLICATE THE CLOSED-LOOP SPEAK TO ITS CONTINUED     VALUE AND TO THE INTENSELY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE     OPERATE.     GLOBAL     NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICES \\x97     REGULATION         LOCAL REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE ISSUANCE OF CHARGE AND CREDIT     CARDS HAVE NOT BEEN A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IMPACTING GNS\\x92     ARRANGEMENTS WITH BANKS AND QUALIFYING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS,     BECAUSE SUCH BANKS AND INSTITUTIONS GENERALLY ARE ALREADY     AUTHORIZED TO ISSUE GENERAL-PURPOSE CARDS AND, IN THE CASE OF     OUR IO ARRANGEMENTS, TO OPERATE MERCHANT-ACQUIRING BUSINESSES.     ACCORDINGLY, OUR GNS PARTNERS HAVE GENERALLY NOT HAD DIFFICULTY     OBTAINING APPROPRIATE GOVERNMENT AUTHORIZATION IN THE COUNTRIES     IN WHICH WE HAVE CHOSEN TO ENTER INTO GNS ARRANGEMENTS. AS A     SERVICE PROVIDER TO REGULATED U.S. BANKS, OUR GNS BUSINESS     IS SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY CERTAIN FEDERAL BANK REGULATORS,     INCLUDING THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE     CORPORATION (\\x93FDIC\\x94), THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF     THE CURRENCY (\\x93OCC\\x94) AND THE OFFICE OF THRIFT     SUPERVISION (\\x93OTS\\x94).         AS THE OPERATOR OF A GENERAL-PURPOSE CARD NETWORK, WE ARE ALSO     SUBJECT TO CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE CURRENCY AND FOREIGN     TRANSACTIONS REPORTING ACT AND THE ACCOMPANYING REGULATIONS     ISSUED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY (COLLECTIVELY     REFERRED TO AS THE \\x93BANK SECRECY ACT\\x94), AS AMENDED BY     THE USA PATRIOT ACT OF 2001 (THE \\x93PATRIOT ACT\\x94). WE     CONDUCT DUE DILIGENCE ON OUR GNS PARTNERS TO ENSURE THAT THEY     HAVE IMPLEMENTED AND MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING     (\\x93AML\\x94) CONTROLS TO PREVENT OUR NETWORK FROM BEING     USED FOR MONEY LAUNDERING OR TERRORIST FINANCING PURPOSES. AS A     RESULT OF AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY AND TRS EACH BEING BANK     HOLDING COMPANIES, OUR BUSINESS IS ALSO SUBJECT TO FURTHER     REGULATION AND REGULATORY OVERSIGHT BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE. FOR     ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR REGULATORY STATUS, PLEASE SEE     \\x93SUPERVISION AND REGULATION \\x97 GENERAL\\x94     BEGINNING ON PAGE 38 BELOW.         IN RECENT YEARS, REGULATORS IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE     UNITED STATES HAVE FOCUSED ON THE FEES INVOLVED IN THE OPERATION     OF CARD NETWORKS, INCLUDING INTERCHANGE FEES PAID TO CARD     ISSUERS AND THE FEES MERCHANTS ARE CHARGED TO ACCEPT CARDS.     REGULATORS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, CANADA, NEW ZEALAND, POLAND,     ITALY, SWITZERLAND, HUNGARY, THE EUROPEAN UNION, AUSTRALIA,     BRAZIL, MEXICO AND VENEZUELA, AMONG OTHERS, HAVE CONDUCTED     INVESTIGATIONS THAT ARE EITHER ONGOING, CONCLUDED, OR ON APPEAL.         THE INTERCHANGE FEE, WHICH IS THE COLLECTIVELY SET FEE PAID BY     THE BANKCARD MERCHANT ACQUIRER TO THE CARD ISSUING BANK IN     \\x93FOUR PARTY\\x94 PAYMENT NETWORKS, LIKE VISA AND     MASTERCARD, IS GENERALLY THE LARGEST COMPONENT OF THE MERCHANT     SERVICE CHARGE PAYABLE BY MERCHANTS FOR BANKCARD DEBIT AND     CREDIT CARD ACCEPTANCE IN THESE          14    TABLE OF CONTENTS        SYSTEMS. BY CONTRAST, THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK DOES NOT HAVE     INTERCHANGE FEES. ALTHOUGH THE REGULATORS\\x92 FOCUS HAS     PRIMARILY BEEN ON VISA AND MASTERCARD AS THE DOMINANT CARD     NETWORKS AND THEIR OPERATIONS ON A MULTILATERAL BASIS, ANTITRUST     ACTIONS AND GOVERNMENT REGULATION RELATING TO MERCHANT PRICING     COULD ULTIMATELY AFFECT ALL NETWORKS. LOWER INTERCHANGE     AND/OR     MERCHANT DISCOUNT REVENUE MAY LEAD CARD ISSUERS TO LOOK FOR     OTHER SOURCES OF REVENUE FROM CONSUMERS SUCH AS HIGHER ANNUAL     CARD FEES OR INTEREST CHARGES, AS WELL AS TO REDUCE COSTS BY     SCALING BACK OR ELIMINATING REWARDS PROGRAMS.         IN THE UNITED STATES, CONGRESS CONTINUED TO FOCUS ON THE     INTERCHANGE ISSUE DURING 2010. CONGRESS PASSED DODD-FRANK, WHICH     THE PRESIDENT SIGNED INTO LAW IN JULY 2010. DODD-FRANK GIVES THE     FEDERAL RESERVE THE AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH RULES REGARDING     INTERCHANGE FEES CHARGED BY PAYMENT CARD ISSUERS FOR     TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH A PERSON USES A DEBIT OR GENERAL-USE     PREPAID CARD, AND TO ENFORCE A NEW STATUTORY REQUIREMENT THAT     SUCH FEES BE REASONABLE AND PROPORTIONAL TO THE ACTUAL COST OF A     TRANSACTION TO THE ISSUER, WITH SPECIFIC ALLOWANCES FOR THE     COSTS OF FRAUD PREVENTION, AS WELL AS TO PROHIBIT EXCLUSIVE     NETWORK ROUTING RESTRICTIONS FOR ELECTRONIC DEBIT TRANSACTIONS.     AMERICAN EXPRESS DOES NOT OFFER A DEBIT CARD LINKED TO A DEPOSIT     ACCOUNT, BUT DOES ISSUE VARIOUS TYPES OF PREPAID CARDS.     RELOADABLE GENERAL-USE PREPAID CARDS, BUT NOT THOSE MARKETED OR     LABELED AS GIFT CARDS OR GIFT CERTIFICATES, ARE EXEMPT FROM THE     INTERCHANGE FEE LIMITATIONS. IN CONTRAST TO THE INTERCHANGE FEE     LIMITATIONS, ALL PREPAID CARDS WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE EXCLUSIVE     NETWORK ROUTING RESTRICTIONS FOR ELECTRONIC DEBIT TRANSACTIONS.     IN DECEMBER 2010, THE FEDERAL RESERVE ISSUED A NOTICE OF     PROPOSED RULEMAKING REQUESTING COMMENTS TO IMPLEMENT THE     INTERCHANGE FEE LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIVE NETWORK ROUTING     RESTRICTIONS. THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS PROPOSED TWO OPTIONS FOR     THE INTERCHANGE LIMITATIONS AND DESCRIBES TWO INTERPRETATIONS OF     THE STATUTORY LANGUAGE ON THE EXCLUSIVE NETWORK ROUTING     RESTRICTIONS. COMMENTS ON THE PROPOSAL WERE DUE BY     FEBRUARY 22, 2011. THE FEDERAL RESERVE MUST ISSUE FINAL     RULES ON THE INTERCHANGE LIMITATIONS BY APRIL 2011, AND THOSE     RULES TAKE EFFECT ON JULY 21, 2011. THE FEDERAL RESERVE     MUST ISSUE FINAL RULES ON THE EXCLUSIVE NETWORK ROUTING     RESTRICTIONS BY JULY 21, 2011. THE STATUTE DOES NOT SPECIFY     WHEN THOSE RULES MUST TAKE EFFECT. THE PROPOSED RULES ISSUED BY     THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAVE GARNERED ATTENTION FROM MEMBERS OF     CONGRESS, AND THE RELEVANT CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES HAVE HELD     HEARINGS TO REVIEW THE PROPOSAL. IT IS DIFFICULT TO ASSESS AT     THIS TIME THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE FINAL REGULATIONS, ONCE     ISSUED, COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY.         ADDITIONALLY, DODD-FRANK PROHIBITS PAYMENT CARD NETWORKS FROM     RESTRICTING MERCHANTS FROM OFFERING DISCOUNTS OR INCENTIVES TO     ENCOURAGE CUSTOMERS TO PAY WITH PARTICULAR FORMS OF PAYMENT SUCH     AS CASH, CHECK, CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD, PROVIDED THAT SUCH OFFERS     DO NOT DISCRIMINATE ON THE BASIS OF THE NETWORK OR ISSUER.     FURTHER, TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW OR APPLICABLE     STATE LAW, THE DISCOUNT OR INCENTIVE MUST BE OFFERED TO ALL     PROSPECTIVE BUYERS AND MUST BE CLEARLY AND CONSPICUOUSLY     DISCLOSED. DODD-FRANK ALSO PERMITS U.S. MERCHANTS TO     ESTABLISH MINIMUM PURCHASE AMOUNTS OF NO MORE THAN $10 FOR     CREDIT CARD PURCHASES, PROVIDED THAT THE MERCHANTS DO NOT     DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN NETWORKS OR ISSUERS. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT     AGENCIES AND INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING ARE ALSO PERMITTED     TO ESTABLISH MAXIMUM AMOUNTS FOR CREDIT CARD PURCHASES PROVIDED     THEY DO NOT DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN NETWORKS OR ISSUERS. AS A     RESULT OF THESE NEW LAWS, CUSTOMERS MAY BE INCENTIVIZED BY     MERCHANTS TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE USE OF CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD     PRODUCTS TO OTHER FORMS OF PAYMENT, SUCH AS DEBIT, WHICH COULD     ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY. DURING THE LAST     FOUR YEARS, A NUMBER OF BILLS WERE PROPOSED IN INDIVIDUAL STATE     LEGISLATURES SEEKING TO IMPOSE CAPS ON CREDIT CARD INTERCHANGE     FEES OR TO PROHIBIT CREDIT CARD COMPANIES FROM CHARGING A     MERCHANT DISCOUNT ON THE SALES TAX PORTION OF CREDIT CARD     PURCHASES. OTHER PROPOSALS WERE AIMED AT INCREASING THE     TRANSPARENCY OF CARD NETWORK RULES FOR MERCHANTS. IN ADDITION, A     NUMBER OF BILLS WERE PROPOSED TO ESTABLISH MERCHANT LIABILITY     FOR THE COSTS OF A DATA SECURITY BREACH OF A MERCHANT\\x92S     SYSTEM OR REQUIRE MERCHANTS TO ADOPT TECHNICAL SAFEGUARDS TO     PROTECT SENSITIVE CARDHOLDER PAYMENT INFORMATION. IN 2010,     VERMONT ENACTED LEGISLATION THAT PERMITS MERCHANTS TO SET A     MINIMUM DOLLAR VALUE OF NO MORE THAN $10 FOR ACCEPTANCE OF ANY     FORM OF PAYMENT; PERMITS MERCHANTS TO PROVIDE DISCOUNTS OR OTHER     BENEFITS BASED ON THE FORM OF PAYMENT (I.E., CARD, CASH, CHECK,     DEBIT CARD, STORED-VALUE CARD, CHARGE CARD OR CREDIT CARD); AND     PERMITS MERCHANTS TO ACCEPT THE CARDS OF A PAYMENT SYSTEM AT ONE     OR MORE OF ITS LOCATIONS BUT NOT AT OTHERS. THIS LEGISLATION MAY     SERVE AS A MODEL FOR OTHER STATES. IN THE EVENT THAT ADDITIONAL     LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY ACTIVITY TO LIMIT INTERCHANGE OR     MERCHANT FEES CONTINUES OR INCREASES, OR STATE DATA SECURITY     LEGISLATION IS ADOPTED, OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY COULD BE     ADVERSELY AFFECTED.         15    TABLE OF CONTENTS        IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES WHERE ANTITRUST ACTIONS OR REGULATIONS HAVE     LED OUR COMPETITORS TO LOWER THEIR FEES, WE HAVE MADE     ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR PRICING TO MERCHANTS TO REFLECT LOCAL     COMPETITIVE TRENDS. FOR EXAMPLE, REDUCTIONS IN BANKCARD     INTERCHANGE MANDATED BY THE RESERVE BANK OF AUSTRALIA IN 2003     RESULTED IN LOWER MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATES FOR VISA AND     MASTERCARD ACCEPTANCE. AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN THE     MARKETPLACE, WE REDUCED OUR OWN MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATES IN     AUSTRALIA OVER TIME, ALTHOUGH WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO INCREASE     BILLED BUSINESS AND THE NUMBER OF MERCHANTS ACCEPTING OUR CARDS.     IN ADDITION, UNDER LEGISLATION ENACTED IN ARGENTINA, A MERCHANT     ACQUIRER IS REQUIRED TO CHARGE THE SAME MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE     TO ALL MERCHANTS IN THE SAME INDUSTRY CATEGORY, AND MERCHANT     DISCOUNT RATES FOR CREDIT CARDS CANNOT EXCEED 3%. THE CENTRAL     BANK OF VENEZUELA HAS ISSUED REGULATIONS REGARDING THE MAXIMUM     LEVEL OF MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATES BY INDUSTRY CATEGORY. IN     DECEMBER 2007, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION RULED THAT     MASTERCARD\\x92S MULTILATERAL INTERCHANGE FEES     (\\x93MIF\\x94) FOR CROSS-BORDER PAYMENT CARD TRANSACTIONS     VIOLATE EC TREATY RULES ON RESTRICTIVE BUSINESS PRACTICES. THE     COMMISSION\\x92S DECISION APPLIES TO CROSS-BORDER CONSUMER     CREDIT, CHARGE AND DEBIT CARD TRANSACTIONS WITHIN THE EU AND TO     DOMESTIC TRANSACTIONS TO WHICH MASTERCARD HAS CHOSEN TO APPLY     THE CROSS-BORDER MIF. THE RULING DOES NOT PREVENT MASTERCARD AND     ITS MEMBER BANKS FROM ADOPTING AN ALTERNATIVE MIF ARRANGEMENT     THAT CAN BE PROVEN TO COMPLY WITH EU COMPETITION RULES. ALTHOUGH     THE COMMISSION\\x92S INVESTIGATION INCLUDED COMMERCIAL CARDS,     IT HAS RESERVED JUDGMENT FOR THE TIME BEING ON THE LEGALITY OF     MASTERCARD\\x92S CROSS-BORDER MIF FOR COMMERCIAL CARD     TRANSACTIONS. MASTERCARD LODGED AN APPEAL AGAINST THE     COMMISSION\\x92S FINDINGS, WHICH IS PENDING. AN INTERIM     SETTLEMENT, PENDING THE APPEAL, WAS AGREED TO IN 2009 BETWEEN     THE COMMISSION AND MASTERCARD, CAPPING MIF AT 30 BASIS     POINTS FOR CONSUMER CARD TRANSACTIONS AND 20 BASIS POINTS     FOR DEBIT CARD TRANSACTIONS.         IN 2002, THE COMMISSION GRANTED AN EXEMPTION TO VISA REGARDING     ITS MIFS FOR CROSS-BORDER CONSUMER CARD TRANSACTIONS WITHIN     EUROPE. THIS EXEMPTION EXPIRED ON DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND IN     MARCH 2008 THE COMMISSION OPENED FORMAL ANTITRUST PROCEEDINGS     AGAINST VISA EUROPE LIMITED IN RELATION TO VISA\\x92S MIFS FOR     SUCH TRANSACTIONS. THE COMMISSION INDICATED THAT THE MASTERCARD     DECISION SHOULD \\x93PROVIDE VISA WITH GUIDANCE FOR THE WAY     AHEAD,\\x94 ALTHOUGH IT STATED THAT \\x93EVERY MIF MUST BE     EXAMINED ON ITS OWN MERITS.\\x94 IN 2010, THE COMMISSION     ACCEPTED VISA EUROPE\\x92S PLEDGE TO CUT ITS CROSS-BORDER DEBIT     CARD MIF TO 20 BASIS POINTS FOR FOUR YEARS. THE     COMMISSION\\x92S INVESTIGATION INTO VISA EUROPE\\x92S CREDIT     AND DEFERRED DEBIT CARD MIF FOR CROSS-BORDER TRANSACTIONS     REMAINS ONGOING.         DEVELOPMENTS AT THE EU LEVEL MAY AFFECT HOW THE COMPETITION     AUTHORITIES IN THE MEMBER STATES OF THE EU VIEW DOMESTIC     INTERCHANGE AND THE PROGRESS OF ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS. IN 2007,     FOR EXAMPLE, CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMISSION\\x92S FINDINGS OF     THAT YEAR IN ITS CASE AGAINST MASTERCARD, THE COMPETITION     REGULATOR IN POLAND FOUND INSUFFICIENT BASIS FOR VISA AND     MASTERCARD INTERCHANGE FEES AND ORDERED THE ASSOCIATIONS AND     THEIR MEMBERS TO STOP THEIR CURRENT INTERCHANGE SETTING     PRACTICES. HOWEVER, THE BANKS APPEALED THAT DECISION, AND IN     NOVEMBER 2008 THE DECISION WAS OVERTURNED. THE POLISH     COMPETITION AUTHORITY HAS APPEALED THAT RULING. MORE RECENTLY,     THE OFFICE OF FAIR TRADING IN THE UNITED KINGDOM INDICATED THAT     IT WAS DELAYING FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF ITS CASES AGAINST     MASTERCARD AND VISA PENDING THE OUTCOME OF THE APPEAL OF THE     EUROPEAN COMMISSION\\x92S DECISION AGAINST MASTERCARD.         IN 2010, NATIONAL PARLIAMENTS IN HUNGARY AND FRANCE ENACTED     LEGISLATION TO CAP INTERCHANGE FEES OR POINT OF SALE SERVICE     CHARGES WITHOUT GOVERNMENT SPONSORSHIP FOR THESE MEASURES.     ALTHOUGH IN BOTH CASES THE LEGISLATION HAS BEEN EITHER REPEALED     OR STRUCK DOWN ON PROCEDURAL GROUNDS, IT IS POSSIBLE THERE MAY     BE FURTHER ATTEMPTS TO ENACT REGULATION OF MERCHANT FEES OR     INTERCHANGE WITH DIRECT OR INDIRECT IMPACTS ON AMERICAN EXPRESS.         IN AUGUST 2009, VISA AND MASTERCARD SETTLED AN ANTI-TRUST CASE     WITH THE NEW ZEALAND REGULATORY AUTHORITIES REGARDING WHETHER     THE SETTING OF INTERCHANGE RATES CONSTITUTED PRICE FIXING AND     WHETHER OTHER SCHEME RULES LESSENED COMPETITION. THE SETTLEMENT     RESULTS IN CHANGES TO THE VISA AND MASTERCARD SCHEME RULES,     WHICH WILL SET MAXIMUM INTERCHANGE RATES AND ALSO ALLOW     BILATERAL SETTING OF LOWER INTERCHANGE RATES BETWEEN ISSUERS AND     ACQUIRERS, AS WELL AS REMOVE THE SCHEMES\\x92 NO SURCHARGING     RULES. ON APRIL 17, 2010, EACH OF THE SCHEMES RELEASED     THEIR MAXIMUM INTERCHANGE RATES. IT IS DIFFICULT TO ASSESS AT     THIS TIME THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE CHANGES TO INTERCHANGE COULD     ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY IN NEW ZEALAND.         REGULATORS HAVE ALSO CONSIDERED NETWORK RULES THAT PROHIBIT     MERCHANTS FROM SURCHARGING CARD PURCHASES. IN AUSTRALIA, WE HAVE     SEEN SELECTIVE, BUT INCREASING, MERCHANT SURCHARGING ON OUR     CARDS IN CERTAIN INDUSTRIES          16    TABLE OF CONTENTS        AND, IN SOME CASES, ON A BASIS THAT IS GREATER THAN THAT APPLIED     TO CARDS ISSUED ON THE BANKCARD NETWORKS. THE MEMBER STATES OF     THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA HAVE NOW IMPLEMENTED A RELATIVELY NEW     LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK FOR ELECTRONIC PAYMENT SERVICES, INCLUDING     CARDS, CALLED THE EUROPEAN DIRECTIVE 2007/64/EC ON PAYMENT     SERVICES. THIS DIRECTIVE, COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE PAYMENT     SERVICES DIRECTIVE, PRESCRIBES COMMON RULES FOR LICENSING AND     SUPERVISION OF PAYMENT SERVICES PROVIDERS, INCLUDING CARD     ISSUERS AND MERCHANT ACQUIRERS, AND FOR THEIR CONDUCT OF     BUSINESS WITH CUSTOMERS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PAYMENT SERVICES     DIRECTIVE IS TO FACILITATE THE OPERATION OF A SINGLE INTERNAL     PAYMENTS MARKET IN THE EU THROUGH HARMONIZATION OF EU MEMBER     STATE LAWS GOVERNING PAYMENT SERVICES. ONE PROVISION OF THE     PAYMENT SERVICES DIRECTIVE PERMITS MERCHANTS TO SURCHARGE,     SUBJECT TO DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS, BUT ALSO ALLOWS INDIVIDUAL     MEMBER STATES TO OVERRIDE THIS RULE BY PROHIBITING OR LIMITING     SURCHARGING. TO DATE, THE MEMBER STATES OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC     AREA ARE SPLIT ON WHETHER THEY PROHIBIT OR PERMIT SURCHARGING,     WITH COUNTRIES SUCH AS THE UNITED KINGDOM (WHICH FOR A NUMBER OF     YEARS HAS PERMITTED IT FOR CREDIT CARD PURCHASES), THE     NETHERLANDS AND SPAIN PERMITTING IT, IN SOME CASES WITHIN     LIMITS, AND OTHER COUNTRIES SUCH AS FRANCE, ITALY AND SWEDEN     PROHIBITING IT. ALL MEMBER STATES PERMIT DISCOUNTS. THE PAYMENT     SERVICES DIRECTIVE COMPLEMENTS ANOTHER EUROPEAN INITIATIVE, THE     SINGLE EURO PAYMENTS AREA (\\x93SEPA\\x94), WHICH IS AN     INDUSTRY-LED INITIATIVE WITH SUPPORT FROM EU INSTITUTIONS. AMONG     OTHER CHANGES, SEPA INVOLVES THE ADOPTION OF NEW, PAN-EUROPEAN     TECHNICAL STANDARDS FOR CARDS AND CARD TRANSACTIONS. ALL OF THE     FOREGOING REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT COSTS TO IMPLEMENT AND MAINTAIN.         THE CANADIAN COMPETITION BUREAU HAS COMMENCED AN APPLICATION     AGAINST VISA AND MASTERCARD UNDER THE PRICE MAINTENANCE     PROVISIONS OF THE CANADIAN COMPETITION ACT SEEKING A REMEDIAL     ORDER PROHIBITING VISA AND MASTERCARD FROM ENTERING INTO,     ENFORCING OR IMPOSING TERMS THAT RESTRAIN MERCHANTS FROM CERTAIN     BUSINESS PRACTICES, INCLUDING ENCOURAGING USE OF LOWER COST     METHODS OF PAYMENT AND DISCOURAGING USE OF CREDIT CARDS WITH     HIGHER CARD ACCEPTANCE FEES, DECLINING ACCEPTANCE OF CERTAIN     CREDIT CARDS AND SURCHARGING CUSTOMERS WHO USE VISA AND     MASTERCARD CREDIT CARDS. WHILE THE COMPETITION BUREAU DID NOT     NAME AMERICAN EXPRESS IN ITS APPLICATION, THIS ACTION EVIDENCES     THE STRONG REGULATORY AND JUDICIAL FOCUS ON THIS AREA, WHICH     COULD HAVE INDIRECT IMPLICATIONS FOR AMERICAN EXPRESS.         THE CANADIAN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE REQUIRES AMEX BANK OF CANADA     AS WELL AS OTHER PAYMENT NETWORKS, ISSUERS AND ACQUIRERS TO     ADHERE TO THE CODE OF CONDUCT FOR THE CREDIT AND DEBIT CARD     INDUSTRY IN CANADA WHICH AMONG OTHER THINGS REQUIRES INCREASED     TRANSPARENCY AND DISCLOSURE OF FEES IN MERCHANT AGREEMENTS AND     MONTHLY STATEMENTS, REQUIRES 90 DAYS NOTICE OF MERCHANT FEE     INCREASES OR INTRODUCTION OF NEW FEES AND GIVES MERCHANTS THE     RIGHT TO CANCEL THEIR CONTRACT WITHOUT PENALTY AFTER RECEIVING     SUCH NOTICE, ALLOWS DIFFERENTIAL DISCOUNTING BY MERCHANTS     BETWEEN FORMS OF PAYMENT AND PAYMENT NETWORKS AND REQUIRES THAT     MERCHANTS PROVIDE THEIR EXPRESS CONSENT TO ACCEPT NEW PRODUCTS     OR SERVICES.      U.S. CARD     SERVICES          AS A SIGNIFICANT PART OF OUR PROPRIETARY CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS,     OUR U.S. BANKING SUBSIDIARIES, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB,     ISSUE A WIDE RANGE OF CARD PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO CONSUMERS     AND SMALL BUSINESSES IN THE UNITED STATES. OUR CONSUMER TRAVEL     BUSINESS, WHICH PROVIDES TRAVEL SERVICES TO CARDMEMBERS AND     OTHER CONSUMERS, COMPLEMENTS OUR CORE CARD BUSINESS, AS DOES OUR     GLOBAL PAYMENT OPTIONS BUSINESS.         THE PROPRIETARY CARD BUSINESS OFFERS A BROAD SET OF CARD     PRODUCTS TO ATTRACT OUR TARGET CUSTOMER BASE. AS WE CONTINUE TO     FOCUS ON PREMIUM PRODUCTS, THE COMPANY\\x92S PRIORITY WILL BE     TO DRIVE BILLED BUSINESS AND AVERAGE SPEND PER CARD RATHER THAN     ACHIEVE BROAD GROWTH IN     CARDS-IN-FORCE.     CORE ELEMENTS OF OUR STRATEGY ARE:                 \\x95        FOCUSING ON ACQUIRING AND RETAINING HIGH-SPENDING, CREDITWORTHY     CARDMEMBERS            \\x95        DESIGNING CARD PRODUCTS WITH FEATURES THAT APPEAL TO SPECIFIC     CUSTOMER SEGMENTS            \\x95        USING STRONG INCENTIVES TO DRIVE SPENDING ON OUR VARIOUS CARD     PRODUCTS, INCLUDING OUR MEMBERSHIP     REWARDS®      PROGRAM AND OTHER REWARDS FEATURES            \\x95        USING LOYALTY PROGRAMS SUCH AS DELTA SKYMILES, SPONSORED BY OUR     CO-BRAND AND OTHER PARTNERS TO DRIVE SPENDING            \\x95        DEVELOPING AND NURTURING WIDE-RANGING RELATIONSHIPS WITH     CO-BRAND AND OTHER PARTNERS           17    TABLE OF CONTENTS                  \\x95        PROMOTING AND USING INCENTIVES FOR CARDMEMBERS TO USE THEIR     CARDS IN NEW AND EXPANDED MERCHANT CATEGORIES, INCLUDING     EVERYDAY SPEND AND TRADITIONAL CASH AND CHECK CATEGORIES            \\x95        PROVIDING EXCEPTIONAL CUSTOMER SERVICE.           IN AUGUST 2010, J.D. POWER AND ASSOCIATES RELEASED ITS     ANNUAL NATIONWIDE CREDIT CARD SATISFACTION STUDY AND RANKED     AMERICAN EXPRESS HIGHEST IN OVERALL SATISFACTION AMONG 10 OF THE     LARGEST CARD ISSUERS IN THE UNITED STATES, FOR THE FOURTH     CONSECUTIVE YEAR.     CONSUMER AND     SMALL BUSINESS SERVICES              WE OFFER INDIVIDUAL CONSUMER CHARGE CARDS SUCH AS THE AMERICAN     EXPRESS®      CARD, THE AMERICAN     EXPRESS®      GOLD CARD, THE PLATINUM     CARD®,      AND THE     CENTURION®      CARD, AS WELL AS THE     ZYNC®      CARD FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS; REVOLVING CREDIT CARDS SUCH AS BLUE     FROM AMERICAN     EXPRESS®,      BLUE     CASH®      CARD FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS, BLUE SKY FROM AMERICAN     EXPRESSSM,      AND BLUE SKY PREFERRED FROM AMERICAN     EXPRESSSM;      AND A VARIETY OF CARDS SPONSORED BY AND CO-BRANDED WITH OTHER     CORPORATIONS AND INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS THE DELTA     SKYMILES®      CREDIT CARD FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS,     TRUE-EARNINGS®      CARD EXCLUSIVELY FOR COSTCO MEMBERS, STARWOOD PREFERRED     GUEST®      CREDIT CARD AND JETBLUE CARD FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS.

CHARGE     CARDS         OUR CHARGE CARDS, WHICH GENERALLY CARRY NO PRESET SPENDING     LIMITS, ARE PRIMARILY DESIGNED AS A METHOD OF PAYMENT AND NOT AS     A MEANS OF FINANCING PURCHASES OF GOODS OR SERVICES. CHARGES ARE     APPROVED BASED ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS INCLUDING A     CARDMEMBER\\x92S CURRENT SPENDING PATTERNS, PAYMENT HISTORY,     CREDIT RECORD, AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES. CARDMEMBERS GENERALLY     MUST PAY THE FULL AMOUNT BILLED EACH MONTH, AND NO FINANCE     CHARGES ARE ASSESSED ON THE BALANCE. CHARGE CARD ACCOUNTS THAT     ARE PAST DUE ARE SUBJECT, IN MOST CASES, TO A DELINQUENCY     ASSESSMENT AND, IF NOT BROUGHT TO CURRENT STATUS, MAY BE     CANCELLED. THE NO PRESET-SPENDING LIMIT AND     PAY-IN-FULL     NATURE OF THESE PRODUCTS ATTRACT HIGH-SPENDING CARDMEMBERS.         THE CHARGE CARDS ALSO OFFER SEVERAL WAYS FOR ELIGIBLE U.S.     CARDMEMBERS TO PAY OFF CERTAIN OF THEIR PURCHASES OVER TIME. THE     SIGN &     TRAVEL®      FEATURE PERMITS ELIGIBLE U.S. CARDMEMBERS TO EXTEND PAYMENT     FOR AIRLINE TICKETS, CRUISE SHIP TICKETS AND OTHER TRAVEL     CHARGES PURCHASED WITH OUR CHARGE CARDS. THE EXTENDED PAYMENT     OPTION PERMITS ELIGIBLE U.S. CARDMEMBERS TO EXTEND PAYMENT     FOR ELIGIBLE CHARGES ABOVE A CERTAIN DOLLAR AMOUNT.         AS PART OF OUR EFFORT TO DELIVER ADDITIONAL VALUE FOR EXISTING     CARDMEMBERS AND TO ATTRACT NEW HIGH-SPENDING CUSTOMERS TO     AMERICAN EXPRESS, WE LAUNCHED IN 2010 THE FOLLOWING THREE NEW     BENEFITS FOR OUR PLATINUM     CARD®      AND CENTURION     CARD®      THAT WILL PROVIDE OUR CONSUMER AND     OPEN®      CARDMEMBERS WITH IMPROVED VALUE AND SERVICE WHILE TRAVELING:                 \\x95        A $200 AIRLINE FEE CREDIT THAT ALLOWS CARDMEMBERS TO ENROLL AND     RECEIVE UP TO $200 ANNUALLY ON INCIDENTAL FEES ON THEIR AIRLINE     OF CHOICE            \\x95        A 20% TRAVEL BONUS BENEFIT THAT GIVES BACK TO CARDMEMBERS 20% OF     THE POINTS THEY REDEEM FOR TRAVEL WHEN THEY USE MEMBERSHIP     REWARDS®      PAY WITH POINTS            \\x95        A SPECIAL VERSION OF THE NEW AMERICAN EXPRESS TRAVEL IPHONE     APPLICATION.           WE ALSO ANNOUNCED IN DECEMBER 2010 THAT WE WILL ELIMINATE     FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTION FEES FOR U.S. CONSUMER AND     SMALL BUSINESS CARDMEMBERS WHO MAKE INTERNATIONAL PURCHASES WITH     THEIR PLATINUM     CARDS®      OR     CENTURION®      CARDS, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE EFFECTIVE TOWARDS THE END OF THE     FIRST QUARTER OF 2011.         IN SEPTEMBER 2010, WE ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT CONTINENTAL AIRLINES     WILL NO LONGER PARTICIPATE IN THE AIRPORT CLUB ACCESS PROGRAM     FOR CENTURION AND PLATINUM CARDMEMBERS OR THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS     POINTS TRANSFER PROGRAM AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2011. HOWEVER,     CARDMEMBERS WILL STILL BE ABLE TO REDEEM POINTS FOR TRAVEL ON     CONTINENTAL     AIRLINES®      THROUGH MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PAY WITH     POINTS®.      WHILE CONTINENTAL AIRLINES WAS A SIGNIFICANT PARTICIPANT IN THE     AIRPORT CLUB ACCESS PROGRAM AND KEY REDEMPTION PARTNER IN OUR     MEMBERSHIP REWARDS POINTS TRANSFER PROGRAM, WE CONTINUE TO     STRENGTHEN OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR CARDMEMBERS BY ENHANCING     THE VALUE WE PROVIDE THROUGH OUR PREMIUM OFFERINGS AND BENEFITS,     INCLUDING THOSE LISTED ABOVE.         IN MAY 2010, WE LAUNCHED THE     ZYNC®      CARD FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS, A NEW CHARGE CARD WITH A LOW ANNUAL     FEE OF $25. CARDMEMBERS GET CORE CHARGE CARD FEATURES AND     PROTECTIONS ON THE BASE CARD WITH THE ADDED FLEXIBILITY TO     SELECT BUNDLES OF REWARDS AND BENEFITS CALLED \\x93PACKS\\x94     THAT ARE TAILORED TO SPECIFIC LIFESTYLE INTERESTS AND SPENDING     HABITS IN CATEGORIES SUCH AS MUSIC, FASHION, FOOD, TRAVEL AND     MORE.         19    TABLE OF CONTENTS    REVOLVING     CREDIT CARDS         WE OFFER A VARIETY OF REVOLVING CREDIT CARDS. THESE CARDS HAVE A     RANGE OF DIFFERENT PAYMENT TERMS, INTEREST RATE AND FEE     STRUCTURES, REWARDS PROGRAMS AND CARDMEMBER BENEFITS. REVOLVING     CREDIT CARD PRODUCTS, SUCH AS BLUE FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS, BLUE     CASH FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS AND BLUE SKY FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS,     PROVIDE CARDMEMBERS WITH THE FLEXIBILITY TO PAY THEIR BILL IN     FULL EACH MONTH OR CARRY A MONTHLY BALANCE ON THEIR CARDS TO     FINANCE THE PURCHASE OF GOODS OR SERVICES. ALONG WITH CHARGE     CARDS AND CO-BRAND CARDS, THESE REVOLVING CREDIT CARDS ATTRACT     AFFLUENT CARDMEMBERS AND PROMOTE INCREASED RELEVANCE FOR OUR     EXPANDING MERCHANT NETWORK.         IN 2010, WE LAUNCHED BLUE SKY PREFERRED FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS,     WHICH OFFERS DOUBLE BLUE     SKYSM      POINTS ON HOTEL, DINING AND CAR RENTAL PURCHASES WHICH CAN BE     REDEEMED TOWARDS TRAVEL ANYWHERE, ANYTIME, ON ANY AIRLINE WITH     NO BLACKOUT DATES OR RESTRICTIONS. IN ADDITION, CARDMEMBERS     RECEIVE AN ANNUAL $100 AIRLINE ALLOWANCE FOR USE ON AIRLINE     INCIDENTAL FEES (E.G., CHECKED BAGGAGE FEES, IN-FLIGHT MEALS,     ETC.). BLUE SKY     PREFERREDSM      CARD IS THE FIRST PROPRIETARY LENDING PRODUCT IN THE BLUE CARD     FAMILY WITH AN ANNUAL FEE, DIVERSIFYING THE REVENUE STREAMS OF     THIS PORTFOLIO.     CO-BRAND     CARDS         WE ISSUE CARDS UNDER CO-BRAND AGREEMENTS WITH SELECTED     COMMERCIAL FIRMS IN THE UNITED STATES. THE COMPETITION AMONG     CARD ISSUERS AND NETWORKS FOR ATTRACTIVE CO-BRAND CARD     PARTNERSHIPS IS QUITE INTENSE BECAUSE THESE PARTNERSHIPS CAN     GENERATE HIGH-SPENDING LOYAL CARDHOLDERS. THE DURATION OF OUR     CO-BRAND ARRANGEMENTS GENERALLY RANGES FROM FIVE TO TEN YEARS.     CARDMEMBERS EARN REWARDS PROVIDED BY THE PARTNERS\\x92     RESPECTIVE LOYALTY PROGRAMS BASED UPON THEIR SPENDING ON THE     CO-BRAND CARDS, SUCH AS FREQUENT FLYER MILES, HOTEL LOYALTY     POINTS AND CASH BACK. WE MAKE PAYMENTS TO OUR CO-BRAND PARTNERS,     WHICH CAN BE SIGNIFICANT, BASED PRIMARILY ON THE AMOUNT OF     CARDMEMBER SPENDING AND CORRESPONDING REWARDS EARNED ON SUCH     SPENDING AND, UNDER CERTAIN ARRANGEMENTS, ON THE NUMBER OF     ACCOUNTS ACQUIRED AND RETAINED. WE EXPENSE AMOUNTS DUE UNDER     CO-BRAND ARRANGEMENTS IN THE MONTH EARNED. PAYMENT TERMS VARY BY     ARRANGEMENT, BUT ARE MONTHLY OR QUARTERLY. GENERALLY, ONCE WE     MAKE PAYMENT TO THE CO-BRAND PARTNER, THE PARTNER IS SOLELY     LIABLE FOR PROVIDING REWARDS TO THE CARDMEMBER UNDER THE     CO-BRAND PARTNER\\x92S OWN LOYALTY PROGRAM. AS THE ISSUER OF     THE CO-BRAND CARD, WE RETAIN ALL THE CREDIT RISK WITH THE     CARDMEMBER AND BEAR THE RECEIVABLES FUNDING AND OPERATING     EXPENSES FOR SUCH CARDS. THE CO-BRAND PARTNER RETAINS THE RISK     ASSOCIATED WITH THE MILES, POINTS OR OTHER CURRENCY EARNED BY     THE CARDMEMBER UNDER THE PARTNER\\x92S LOYALTY PROGRAM.         DURING 2010, WE INTRODUCED SEVERAL NEW INNOVATIONS TO OUR     EXISTING PRODUCTS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE LAUNCHED THE FIRST BAG FREE     BENEFIT WHICH ALLOWS GOLD, PLATINUM AND RESERVE DELTA SKYMILES     CREDIT CARD CARDMEMBERS TO CHECK THEIR FIRST BAG FOR FREE ON     DELTA AIR LINES OPERATED FLIGHTS. WE ALSO LAUNCHED TWO NEW     BENEFITS ON THE STARWOOD PREFERRED GUEST CREDIT CARD AND THE     STARWOOD PREFERRED GUEST BUSINESS CREDIT CARD THAT PROVIDES A 5     NIGHT / 2 STAY CREDIT SO CARDMEMBERS EARN ELITE STATUS     FASTER AND AN EXCLUSIVE SHERATON HOTELS AND RESORTS OFFER.     CO-BRAND     PARTNERSHIPS WITH FINANCIAL SERVICES INSTITUTIONS         WE ALSO ISSUE CARDS THAT ARE MARKETED UNDER CO-BRAND PARTNERSHIP     ARRANGEMENTS WITH FINANCIAL SERVICES PARTNERS. SUCH PARTNERSHIPS     INVOLVE THE OFFERING OF A STANDARD PRODUCT (ISSUED BY TRS OR ONE     OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES) TO CUSTOMERS OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES     PARTNER, GENERALLY CO-BRANDED WITH THE PARTNER\\x92S NAME ON     THE CARD. UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, WE MAY MAKE PAYMENTS TO THE     FINANCIAL SERVICES PARTNERS THAT ARE PRIMARILY BASED ON THE     NUMBER OF ACCOUNTS ACQUIRED     AND/OR     RETAINED THROUGH THE ARRANGEMENT     AND/OR THE     AMOUNT OF CARDMEMBER SPENDING ON SUCH CARDS. THE DURATION OF     SUCH ARRANGEMENTS GENERALLY RANGES FROM THREE TO SEVEN YEARS.     CARD     PRICING AND ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT         CERTAIN CARDS, PARTICULARLY CHARGE CARDS, CHARGE AN ANNUAL FEE     THAT VARIES BASED ON THE TYPE OF CARD AND THE NUMBER OF CARDS     FOR EACH ACCOUNT. WE ALSO OFFER MANY REVOLVING CREDIT CARDS WITH     NO ANNUAL FEE BUT ON WHICH WE ASSESS FINANCE CHARGES FOR     REVOLVING BALANCES. DEPENDING ON THE PRODUCT, WE ALSO CHARGE          20    TABLE OF CONTENTS        CARDMEMBERS AN ANNUAL PROGRAM FEE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE     MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAMS AND FEES FOR ACCOUNT PERFORMANCE     (E.G., LATE FEES) OR FOR CERTAIN SERVICES (E.G., ADDITIONAL     COPIES OF ACCOUNT STATEMENTS). WE APPLY STANDARDS AND CRITERIA     FOR CREDITWORTHINESS TO EACH CARDMEMBER THROUGH A VARIETY OF     MEANS BOTH AT THE TIME OF INITIAL SOLICITATION OR APPLICATION     AND ON AN ONGOING BASIS DURING THE CARD RELATIONSHIP. WE USE     SOPHISTICATED CREDIT MODELS AND TECHNIQUES IN OUR RISK     MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS. FOR A FURTHER DESCRIPTION OF OUR RISK     MANAGEMENT POLICIES, PLEASE SEE \\x93RISK MANAGEMENT\\x94     APPEARING ON PAGE 48 OF OUR 2010 ANNUAL REPORT TO     SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH INFORMATION IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY     REFERENCE.     MEMBERSHIP     REWARDS®      PROGRAM         THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS ALLOWS     CARDMEMBERS TO EARN ONE POINT FOR VIRTUALLY EVERY DOLLAR CHARGED     ON ELIGIBLE, ENROLLED AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS, AND THEN REDEEM     POINTS FOR A WIDE ARRAY OF REWARDS, INCLUDING TRAVEL, RETAIL     MERCHANDISE, DINING AND ENTERTAINMENT, FINANCIAL SERVICES AND     EVEN DONATIONS TO BENEFIT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CHARITIES. POINTS     GENERALLY HAVE NO EXPIRATION DATE AND THERE IS NO LIMIT ON THE     NUMBER OF POINTS ONE CAN EARN. A LARGE MAJORITY OF SPENDING BY     ELIGIBLE CARDMEMBERS EARNS POINTS UNDER THIS PROGRAM.         THE U.S. MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM HAS OVER 150 REDEMPTION     PARTNERS AND FEATURES OVER 500 MERCHANDISE BRANDS. MEMBERSHIP     REWARDS PROGRAM TIERS ARE ALIGNED WITH SPECIFIC CARD PRODUCTS TO     BETTER MEET CARDMEMBER LIFESTYLE AND REWARD PROGRAM USAGE NEEDS.     AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDMEMBERS PARTICIPATE IN ONE OF THREE     MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM TIERS BASED ON THE CREDIT OR CHARGE     CARD THEY HAVE IN THEIR WALLET. FOR THOSE CARDMEMBERS WITH     AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS, SUCH AS BLUE FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS AND     ZYNC FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS, WE HAVE THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS     EXPRESS®      PROGRAM. AMERICAN EXPRESS CHARGE CARDMEMBERS WITH AMERICAN     EXPRESS GREEN AND GOLD CARDS HAVE THE MEMBERSHIP     REWARDS®      PROGRAM. PLATINUM     CARD®      MEMBERS AND     CENTURION®      CARDMEMBERS ARE ENROLLED IN THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS     FIRST®      PROGRAM.         DURING THE YEAR, WE ENHANCED OUR MEMBERSHIP     REWARDS®      PROGRAM WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW REWARD OPTIONS DESIGNED TO     MEET CUSTOMER DEMAND AND PROVIDE CARDMEMBERS WITH GREATER     BREADTH AND VARIETY AS WELL AS UTILITY. FOR EXAMPLE, WE LAUNCHED     A NEW BENEFIT THAT ALLOWS MEMBERSHIP REWARDS POINTS TO BE USED     FOR PURCHASES ON AMAZON.COM AT THE POINT OF SALE. IN ADDITION TO     THIS REDEMPTION OPTION AT AMAZON, WE HAVE ADDED A NUMBER OF NEW     PARTNERS TO THE PROGRAM THAT GIVE CARDMEMBERS A BROADER RANGE OF     OPPORTUNITIES TO REDEEM POINTS, SUCH AS UNIVERSAL STUDIOS THEME     PARKS, FOUR SEASONS HOTELS AND RESORTS, VICTORIA\\x92S SECRET,     RUBY TUESDAY AND ZYNGA. IN ADDITION, CARDMEMBERS NOW HAVE THE     ABILITY TO PAY FOR THEIR ANNUAL MEMBERSHIP FEE WITH MEMBERSHIP     REWARDS POINTS. WE BELIEVE OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS POINT BANK IS     A SUBSTANTIAL ASSET AND A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE, AND IS MOVING     TOWARDS BECOMING A VALUED VIRTUAL CURRENCY.         WHEN A CARDMEMBER ENROLLED IN THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM     USES THE CARD, WE ESTABLISH RESERVES TO COVER THE COST OF     ESTIMATED FUTURE REWARD REDEMPTIONS FOR POINTS EARNED TO DATE.     WHEN A MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM ENROLLEE REDEEMS A REWARD     USING MEMBERSHIP REWARDS POINTS, WE MAKE A PAYMENT TO THE     MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM PARTNER PROVIDING THE REWARD PURSUANT     TO CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS. MEMBERSHIP REWARDS EXPENSE IS     DRIVEN BY CARDMEMBER CHARGE VOLUME, CUSTOMER PARTICIPATION IN     THE PROGRAM, AND CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH REDEMPTION     PARTNERS. AT YEAR END, WE ESTIMATED THAT CURRENT CARDMEMBERS     WILL ULTIMATELY REDEEM APPROXIMATELY 90% OF THEIR POINTS. FOR     MORE INFORMATION ON OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM, SEE     \\x93CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES \\x97 RESERVES FOR     MEMBERSHIP REWARDS COSTS\\x94 APPEARING ON PAGE 25 OF OUR     2010 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH INFORMATION IS     INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.         MEMBERSHIP REWARDS CONTINUES TO BE AN IMPORTANT DRIVER OF     CARDMEMBER SPENDING AND LOYALTY. WE BELIEVE, BASED ON HISTORICAL     EXPERIENCE, THAT CARDMEMBERS ENROLLED IN REWARDS PROGRAMS YIELD     HIGHER SPEND, STRONGER CREDIT PERFORMANCE AND GREATER PROFIT FOR     US. BY OFFERING A BROADER RANGE OF REDEMPTION CHOICES, WE          21    TABLE OF CONTENTS        HAVE GIVEN OUR CARDMEMBERS MORE FLEXIBILITY IN THE USE OF THEIR     REWARDS POINTS AND HAVE FAVORABLY AFFECTED OUR AVERAGE COST PER     POINT. WE CONTINUALLY SEEK TO OPTIMIZE THE OVERALL ECONOMICS OF     THE PROGRAM AND MAKE CHANGES TO ENHANCE ITS VALUE TO     CARDMEMBERS. OUR PROGRAM IS ALSO VALUABLE TO MERCHANTS THAT     BECOME REDEMPTION PARTNERS AS WE BRING THEM HIGH-SPENDING     CARDMEMBERS AND NEW MARKETING CHANNELS TO REACH THESE     CARDMEMBERS.

CARD-ISSUING     BUSINESS \\x97 COMPETITION         OUR PROPRIETARY CARD BUSINESS ENCOUNTERS SUBSTANTIAL AND INTENSE     COMPETITION IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY. AS A CARD     ISSUER, WE COMPETE IN THE UNITED STATES WITH FINANCIAL     INSTITUTIONS (SUCH AS CITIBANK, BANK OF AMERICA, JPMORGAN CHASE,     AND CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL) THAT ISSUE GENERAL-PURPOSE CHARGE AND     REVOLVING CREDIT CARDS, AND DISCOVER FINANCIAL SERVICES, WHICH     ISSUES THE DISCOVER CARD ON THE DISCOVER BUSINESS SERVICES     NETWORK. WE ALSO ENCOUNTER COMPETITION FROM BUSINESSES THAT     ISSUE THEIR OWN CARDS OR OTHERWISE EXTEND CREDIT TO THEIR     CUSTOMERS, SUCH AS RETAILERS AND AIRLINE ASSOCIATIONS, ALTHOUGH     THESE CARDS ARE GENERALLY ACCEPTED ONLY AT LIMITED LOCATIONS.     BECAUSE OF CONTINUING CONSOLIDATIONS AMONG BANKING AND FINANCIAL     SERVICES COMPANIES AND CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO ACQUISITIONS BY     MAJOR CARD ISSUERS, THERE ARE NOW A SMALLER NUMBER OF     SIGNIFICANT ISSUERS. THE LARGEST COMPETING ISSUERS HAVE     CONTINUED TO GROW, IN SEVERAL CASES BY ACQUIRING CARD     PORTFOLIOS, AND ALSO BY CROSS-SELLING THROUGH THEIR RETAIL     BRANCH NETWORKS.         IN RECENT YEARS, WE HAVE ENCOUNTERED INCREASINGLY INTENSE     COMPETITION IN THE SMALL BUSINESS SECTOR, AS COMPETITORS HAVE     TARGETED OPEN\\x92S CUSTOMER BASE AND OUR LEADERSHIP POSITION     IN PROVIDING FINANCIAL SERVICES AND OTHER FEE-BASED SOLUTIONS TO     SMALL BUSINESSES. COMPETING CARD ISSUERS OFFER A VARIETY OF     PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO ATTRACT CARDHOLDERS, INCLUDING PREMIUM     CARDS WITH ENHANCED SERVICES OR LINES OF CREDIT, AIRLINE     FREQUENT FLYER PROGRAM MILEAGE CREDITS, CASH REBATES AND OTHER     REWARD OR REBATE PROGRAMS, SERVICES FOR SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS,     \\x93TEASER\\x94 PROMOTIONAL INTEREST RATES FOR BOTH CREDIT     CARD ACQUISITION AND BALANCE TRANSFERS, AND CO-BRANDED     ARRANGEMENTS WITH PARTNERS THAT OFFER BENEFITS TO CARDHOLDERS.         MOST FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT OFFER DEMAND DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS     ALSO ISSUE DEBIT CARDS TO PERMIT DEPOSITORS TO ACCESS THEIR     FUNDS. USE OF DEBIT CARDS FOR     POINT-OF-SALE     PURCHASES HAS GROWN AS MOST FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE REPLACED     ATM CARDS WITH GENERAL-PURPOSE DEBIT CARDS BEARING EITHER THE     VISA OR MASTERCARD LOGO. AS A RESULT, THE PURCHASE VOLUME AND     NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS MADE WITH DEBIT CARDS IN THE UNITED     STATES HAS GROWN MORE RAPIDLY THAN CREDIT AND CHARGE CARD     TRANSACTIONS. DEBIT CARDS WERE MARKETED AS REPLACEMENTS FOR CASH     AND CHECKS, AND TRANSACTIONS MADE WITH DEBIT CARDS HAVE     TYPICALLY BEEN FOR SMALLER DOLLAR AMOUNTS. THERE IS NO CREDIT     EXTENDED WHEN A DEBIT CARD IS USED AND THE CONSUMER MUST HAVE     SUFFICIENT FUNDS IN HIS OR HER DEMAND DEPOSIT ACCOUNT TO PAY FOR     THE PURCHASE AT THE TIME OF THE TRANSACTION AS OPPOSED TO CHARGE     CARDS WHERE PAYMENT IS DUE AT THE END OF THE BILLING PERIOD OR     CREDIT CARDS WHERE PAYMENT CAN BE EXTENDED OVER A PERIOD OF     TIME. HOWEVER, DEBIT CARDS ARE ALSO PERCEIVED AS AN ALTERNATIVE     TO CREDIT OR CHARGE CARDS AND USED IN THAT MANNER. WE DO NOT     OFFER A DEBIT CARD LINKED TO A DEPOSIT ACCOUNT, BUT WE DO ISSUE     VARIOUS TYPES OF PREPAID CARDS. AS THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY     CONTINUES TO EVOLVE, WE ARE ALSO FACING INCREASING COMPETITION     FROM NON-TRADITIONAL PLAYERS, SUCH AS ONLINE NETWORKS, TELECOM     PROVIDERS, OR SOFTWARE-AS-A-SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT LEVERAGE NEW     TECHNOLOGIES AND CUSTOMERS\\x92 EXISTING CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD     ACCOUNTS AND BANK RELATIONSHIPS TO CREATE PAYMENT OR OTHER     FEE-BASED SOLUTIONS. IN ADDITION, THE EVOLUTION OF PAYMENT     PRODUCTS IN EMERGING MARKETS MAY          23    TABLE OF CONTENTS        BE DIFFERENT THAN IT HAS BEEN IN DEVELOPED MARKETS. INSTEAD OF     MIGRATING FROM CASH TO CHECKS TO PLASTIC, TECHNOLOGY AND     CONSUMER BEHAVIORS IN THESE MARKETS MAY RESULT IN THE SKIPPING     OF ONE OR MORE STEPS TO ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MECHANISMS SUCH AS     MOBILE PAYMENTS. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE EVOLVING     COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE IN THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY, PLEASE SEE     \\x93GLOBAL NETWORK & MERCHANT     SERVICES\\x97COMPETITION\\x94 BEGINNING ON PAGE 13     ABOVE.

FINANCING     ACTIVITIES         THE COMPANY MEETS ITS FINANCING NEEDS THROUGH A VARIETY OF     SOURCES, INCLUDING CASH OR ASSETS THAT ARE READILY CONVERTIBLE     INTO CASH, DIRECT AND THIRD-PARTY DISTRIBUTED DEPOSITS,     UNSECURED MEDIUM- AND LONG-TERM NOTES, ASSET SECURITIZATIONS,     SECURITIZED BORROWINGS THROUGH A CONDUIT FACILITY AND LONG-TERM     COMMITTED BANK BORROWING FACILITIES IN CERTAIN     NON-U.S. MARKETS.         AMERICAN EXPRESS CREDIT CORPORATION, A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY     OF TRS, ALONG WITH ITS SUBSIDIARIES (\\x93CREDCO\\x94),     ACQUIRES OR FINANCES THE MAJORITY OF CHARGE CARD RECEIVABLES     ARISING FROM THE USE OF CORPORATE CARDS ISSUED IN THE UNITED     STATES AND CONSUMER AND CORPORATE CARDS ISSUED IN CERTAIN     CURRENCIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. CREDCO FUNDS THE     ACQUISITION OR FINANCING OF RECEIVABLES PRINCIPALLY THROUGH THE     SALE OF MEDIUM- AND LONG-TERM NOTES. CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB     FINANCE THEIR REVOLVING CREDIT RECEIVABLES AND CONSUMER AND     SMALL BUSINESS CHARGE CARD RECEIVABLES, IN PART, THROUGH THE     SALE OF MEDIUM-TERM NOTES AND BY OFFERING CONSUMER DEPOSITS IN     THE UNITED STATES. TRS, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB ALSO FUND     RECEIVABLES THROUGH ASSET SECURITIZATION PROGRAMS. THE COST OF     FUNDING CARDMEMBER RECEIVABLES AND LOANS IS A MAJOR EXPENSE OF     CARD OPERATIONS.         (YOU CAN FIND A DISCUSSION OF OUR SECURITIZATION AND OTHER     FINANCING ACTIVITIES ON PAGES 41-44 UNDER THE CAPTION     \\x93FINANCIAL REVIEW,\\x94 AND NOTE 7 ON     PAGES 85-87 OF OUR 2010 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS,     WHICH PORTIONS WE INCORPORATE HEREIN BY REFERENCE.)

DEPOSIT     PROGRAMS         OUR BANKING SUBSIDIARIES OFFER DEPOSITS TO INDIVIDUALS THROUGH     THIRD-PARTY BROKERAGE NETWORKS AS WELL AS DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS.     AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY     $29.7 BILLION IN TOTAL CONSUMER          24    TABLE OF CONTENTS        DEPOSITS. THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY\\x92S OUTSTANDING     U.S. RETAIL DEPOSITS HAVE BEEN RAISED THROUGH THIRD-PARTY     CHANNELS. AS PART OF ITS FUNDING STRATEGY, A MAJORITY OF THE     DEPOSITS RAISED DURING 2010 WERE SOURCED DIRECTLY BY THE COMPANY     WITH CONSUMERS THROUGH PERSONAL SAVINGS FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS.     OUR DEPOSIT-TAKING ACTIVITIES COMPETE WITH OTHER DEPOSIT-TAKING     ORGANIZATIONS THAT SOURCE DEPOSITS THROUGH TELEPHONE, INTERNET     AND OTHER ELECTRONIC DELIVERY CHANNELS, BROKERAGE NETWORKS,     AND/OR     THROUGH BRANCH LOCATIONS. WE COMPETE PRIMARILY IN THE DEPOSIT     SECTORS ON THE BASIS OF RATES AND OUR BRAND REPUTATION FOR     SAFETY AND SERVICE. WE SEEK TO OBTAIN THE DEPOSITS OF NEW     CUSTOMERS AS WELL AS EXISTING CARD CUSTOMERS BY OFFERING     ATTRACTIVE RATES AND MARKETING OUR NAME BRAND.         OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN DEPOSIT FUNDING AND OFFER COMPETITIVE     INTEREST RATES ON DEPOSITS ALSO IS DEPENDENT ON CAPITAL LEVELS     OF OUR BANK SUBSIDIARIES. THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE ACT     (\\x93FDIA\\x94) GENERALLY PROHIBITS A BANK, INCLUDING OUR     BANKING SUBSIDIARIES, FROM ACCEPTING BROKERED DEPOSITS OR     OFFERING INTEREST RATES ON ANY DEPOSITS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER     THAN THE PREVAILING RATE IN ITS NORMAL MARKET AREA OR NATIONALLY     (DEPENDING UPON WHERE THE DEPOSITS ARE SOLICITED), UNLESS     (1) IT IS WELL CAPITALIZED OR (2) IT IS ADEQUATELY     CAPITALIZED AND RECEIVES A WAIVER FROM THE FDIC. A BANK THAT IS     LESS THAN WELL CAPITALIZED GENERALLY MAY NOT PAY AN INTEREST     RATE ON ANY DEPOSIT, INCLUDING     DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER     DEPOSITS, IN EXCESS OF 75 BASIS POINTS OVER THE NATIONAL     RATE PUBLISHED BY THE FDIC UNLESS THE FDIC DETERMINES THAT THE     BANK IS OPERATING IN A HIGH-RATE AREA. AN ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED     INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION MAY NOT ACCEPT, RENEW OR ROLL     OVER ANY BROKERED DEPOSIT UNLESS IT HAS APPLIED FOR AND BEEN     GRANTED A WAIVER OF THIS PROHIBITION BY THE FDIC.     UNDERCAPITALIZED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS MAY NOT SOLICIT     DEPOSITS BY OFFERING INTEREST RATES THAT ARE SIGNIFICANTLY     HIGHER THAN THE PREVAILING RATES OF INTEREST ON INSURED DEPOSITS     IN SUCH INSTITUTION\\x92S NORMAL MARKET AREAS OR IN THE MARKET     AREA IN WHICH SUCH DEPOSITS WOULD OTHERWISE BE ACCEPTED. THERE     ARE NO SUCH RESTRICTIONS ON A BANK THAT IS WELL CAPITALIZED     (PROVIDED SUCH BANK IS NOT SUBJECT TO A CAPITAL MAINTENANCE     PROVISION WITHIN A WRITTEN AGREEMENT, CONSENT ORDER, ORDER TO     CEASE AND DESIST, CAPITAL DIRECTIVE, OR PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION     DIRECTIVE ISSUED BY ITS FEDERAL REGULATOR). IF A DEPOSITORY     INSTITUTION\\x92S FEDERAL REGULATOR DETERMINES THAT IT IS IN AN     UNSAFE OR UNSOUND CONDITION OR IS ENGAGING IN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND     BANKING PRACTICES, THE REGULATOR MAY RECLASSIFY A WELL     CAPITALIZED INSTITUTION AS ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED, REQUIRE AN     ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED INSTITUTION TO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN     RESTRICTIONS AS IF IT WERE UNDERCAPITALIZED, AND REQUIRE AN     UNDERCAPITALIZED INSTITUTION TO TAKE CERTAIN ACTIONS APPLICABLE     TO SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERCAPITALIZED INSTITUTIONS, ALL OF WHICH     WOULD ADVERSELY IMPACT ITS ABILITY TO ACCEPT BROKERED DEPOSITS.     CARD-ISSUING     BUSINESS \\x97 REGULATION         THE CHARGE CARD AND CONSUMER LENDING BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO     EXTENSIVE REGULATION. IN THE UNITED STATES, WE ARE SUBJECT TO A     NUMBER OF FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING:                 \\x95        THE EQUAL CREDIT OPPORTUNITY ACT (WHICH GENERALLY PROHIBITS     DISCRIMINATION IN THE GRANTING AND HANDLING OF CREDIT)            \\x95        THE FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT (\\x93FCRA\\x94), AS AMENDED BY     THE FAIR AND ACCURATE CREDIT TRANSACTIONS ACT (\\x93FACT     ACT\\x94) (WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REGULATES USE BY     CREDITORS OF CONSUMER CREDIT REPORTS AND CREDIT PRESCREENING     PRACTICES AND REQUIRES CERTAIN DISCLOSURES WHEN AN APPLICATION     FOR CREDIT IS REJECTED)            \\x95        THE TRUTH IN LENDING ACT (\\x93TILA\\x94) (WHICH, AMONG OTHER     THINGS, REQUIRES EXTENSIVE DISCLOSURE OF THE TERMS UPON WHICH     CREDIT IS GRANTED), INCLUDING THE AMENDMENTS TO TILA THAT WERE     ADOPTED THROUGH THE ENACTMENT OF THE FAIR CREDIT AND CHARGE CARD     DISCLOSURE ACT (WHICH MANDATES CERTAIN DISCLOSURES ON CREDIT AND     CHARGE CARD APPLICATIONS)            \\x95        THE FAIR CREDIT BILLING ACT (WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS,     REGULATES THE MANNER IN WHICH BILLING INQUIRIES ARE HANDLED AND     SPECIFIES CERTAIN BILLING REQUIREMENTS)            \\x95        THE ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER ACT (WHICH REGULATES DISCLOSURES     AND SETTLEMENT OF TRANSACTIONS FOR ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFERS     INCLUDING THOSE AT ATMS)            \\x95        THE CARD ACT (WHICH PROHIBITS CERTAIN ACTS AND PRACTICES IN     CONNECTION WITH CONSUMER CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTS)           25    TABLE OF CONTENTS                  \\x95        THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION ACT OF 2010 (TITLE X OF     DODD\\x96FRANK) (WHICH PROVIDES FOR THE CREATION OF THE     CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU, A NEW CONSUMER FINANCIAL     SERVICES REGULATOR)            \\x95        REGULATION Z (WHICH WAS RECENTLY AMENDED BY THE FEDERAL     RESERVE TO EXTENSIVELY REVISE THE OPEN END CONSUMER CREDIT     DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS AND TO IMPLEMENT THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE     CARD ACT)            \\x95        FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT GENERALLY PROHIBIT     ENGAGING IN UNFAIR AND DECEPTIVE BUSINESS PRACTICES.           CERTAIN FEDERAL PRIVACY-RELATED LAWS AND REGULATIONS GOVERN THE     COLLECTION AND USE OF CUSTOMER INFORMATION BY FINANCIAL     INSTITUTIONS (SEE \\x93CORPORATE & OTHER\\x94     BELOW). FEDERAL LEGISLATION ALSO REGULATES ABUSIVE DEBT     COLLECTION PRACTICES. IN ADDITION, A NUMBER OF STATES, THE     EUROPEAN UNION, AND MANY FOREIGN COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE     HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONSUMER CREDIT PROTECTION AND DISCLOSURE AND     PRIVACY-RELATED LAWS (IN CERTAIN CASES MORE STRINGENT THAN THE     LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES). BANKRUPTCY AND DEBTOR RELIEF LAWS     AFFECT US TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH LAWS RESULT IN AMOUNTS OWED     BEING CLASSIFIED AS DELINQUENT     AND/OR     CHARGED OFF AS UNCOLLECTIBLE. AS STATED ABOVE, CARD ISSUERS AND     CARD NETWORKS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE BANK     SECRECY ACT AS AMENDED BY THE PATRIOT ACT, WITH REGARD TO     MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING PROGRAMS. FOR A     DISCUSSION OF THESE AND OTHER REGULATIONS AND LEGISLATION THAT     IMPACT OUR BUSINESS, PLEASE SEE \\x93SUPERVISION AND     REGULATION \\x97 GENERAL\\x94 WITHIN     \\x93CORPORATE & OTHER\\x94 BELOW.         AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING IN     PARTICULAR CENTURION BANK, AEBFSB AND OUR OTHER BANK ENTITIES,     ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO     FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. CHANGES IN SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS OR     IN THE REGULATORY APPLICATION OR JUDICIAL INTERPRETATION THEREOF     COULD IMPACT THE MANNER IN WHICH WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS AND THE     COSTS OF COMPLIANCE. THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH OUR     CARD AND LENDING BUSINESSES OPERATE HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY     COMPLEX AND ROBUST, AND FOLLOWING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS OF 2008,     SUPERVISORY EFFORTS TO APPLY RELEVANT LAWS, REGULATIONS AND     POLICIES HAVE BECOME MORE INTENSE. THE U.S. CONGRESS AND     REGULATORS, AS WELL AS VARIOUS CONSUMER ADVOCACY GROUPS, HAVE     CONTINUED TO FOCUS THEIR ATTENTION ON CERTAIN PRACTICES OF     CREDIT CARD ISSUERS, SUCH AS UNFAIR AND DECEPTIVE BUSINESS     PRACTICES, INCREASES IN ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATES     (\\x93APRS\\x94), CHANGES IN THE TERMS OF THE ACCOUNT, AND THE     TYPES AND LEVELS OF FEES AND FINANCIAL CHARGES CHARGED BY CARD     ISSUERS FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, LATE PAYMENTS, RETURNED CHECKS,     PAYMENTS BY TELEPHONE, COPIES OF STATEMENTS AND THE LIKE. IN     AUGUST 2010, AEBFSB ENTERED INTO A PUBLIC, WRITTEN SUPERVISORY     AGREEMENT WITH THE OTS, ITS PRIMARY FEDERAL BANKING REGULATOR,     REQUIRING AEBFSB TO MAKE CERTAIN ENHANCEMENTS TO ITS COMPLIANCE     PROGRAM AND TO COMPLETE CERTAIN CORRECTIVE ACTIONS RELATING TO     COMPLIANCE. WE REGULARLY REVIEW AND, AS APPROPRIATE, REFINE OUR     BUSINESS PRACTICES IN LIGHT OF EXISTING AND ANTICIPATED     DEVELOPMENTS IN LAWS, REGULATIONS AND INDUSTRY TRENDS SO WE CAN     CONTINUE TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESS PRUDENTLY AND CONSISTENT WITH     REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND EXPECTATIONS. FOR INFORMATION ABOUT     THE RECENTLY ENACTED CARD ACT, PLEASE SEE \\x93PRIVACY, FAIR     CREDIT REPORTING\\x94 WITHIN \\x93SUPERVISION AND     REGULATORY \\x97 GENERAL\\x94 BELOW BEGINNING ON     PAGE 48.         IN JANUARY 2003, THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION     COUNCIL (THE \\x93FFIEC\\x94), AN INTERAGENCY BODY COMPOSED OF     THE PRINCIPAL U.S. FEDERAL ENTITIES THAT REGULATE BANKS AND     OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, ISSUED NEW GUIDANCE TO THE     INDUSTRY ON CREDIT CARD ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT AND LOSS ALLOWANCE     PRACTICES (THE \\x93GUIDANCE\\x94). THE GUIDANCE COVERS FIVE     AREAS: (I) CREDIT LINE MANAGEMENT; (II) OVER-LIMIT     PRACTICES; (III) MINIMUM PAYMENT AND NEGATIVE AMORTIZATION     PRACTICES; (IV) WORKOUT AND FORBEARANCE PRACTICES; AND     (V) CERTAIN INCOME (FEE) RECOGNITION AND LOSS ALLOWANCE     PRACTICES. THE GUIDANCE IS GENERALLY APPLICABLE TO ALL     INSTITUTIONS UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF THE FEDERAL BANK     REGULATORY AGENCIES THAT COMPRISE THE FFIEC, ALTHOUGH IT IS     PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE IDENTIFICATION BY BANK REGULATORS IN     THEIR EXAMINATIONS OF OTHER CREDIT CARD LENDERS\\x92 PRACTICES     DEEMED BY THEM TO BE INAPPROPRIATE, PARTICULARLY, BUT NOT     EXCLUSIVELY, WITH REGARD TO SUBPRIME LENDING PROGRAMS. AT     PRESENT, WE DO NOT HAVE ANY LENDING PROGRAMS THAT TARGET THE     SUBPRIME SECTOR. CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB EVALUATE AND DISCUSS     THE GUIDANCE WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE REGULATORS ON AN ONGOING     BASIS AS PART OF THEIR REGULATORY EXAMINATION PROCESSES, AND, AS     A RESULT, MAY REFINE THEIR PRACTICES FROM TIME TO TIME BASED ON     REGULATORY INPUT. THE GUIDANCE HAS NOT HAD, NOR DO WE EXPECT IT     TO HAVE, ANY MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESSES OR PRACTICES.         26    TABLE OF CONTENTS    AMERICAN     EXPRESS CONSUMER TRAVEL NETWORK \\x97 USA         THE AMERICAN EXPRESS CONSUMER TRAVEL NETWORK \\x97 USA     PROVIDES TRAVEL, FINANCIAL AND CARDMEMBER SERVICES TO CONSUMERS     THROUGH AMERICAN EXPRESS-OWNED TRAVEL SERVICE OFFICES, CALL     CENTERS, PARTICIPATING AMERICAN EXPRESS REPRESENTATIVES     (INDEPENDENTLY OWNED TRAVEL AGENCY LOCATIONS THAT OPERATE UNDER     THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND) AND THE CONSUMER TRAVEL WEB SITE.

FOR A DISCUSSION OF CARDS ISSUED     INTERNATIONALLY THROUGH OUR GNS PARTNER RELATIONSHIPS, PLEASE     SEE THE SECTION \\x93GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES\\x94 ABOVE.         THE COMPANY CONTINUED TO BOLSTER ITS INTERNATIONAL PROPRIETARY     CARD BUSINESS THROUGH THE LAUNCH OF NUMEROUS NEW OR ENHANCED     CARD PRODUCTS DURING 2010. THESE ARE CARDS THAT WE ISSUE, EITHER     ON OUR OWN OR AS CO-BRANDS WITH PARTNERING INSTITUTIONS. AS WE     HAVE RENEWED MANY OF OUR CO-BRAND AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTION     DEALS, WE HAVE BEEN FOCUSED ON ADDING NEW PRODUCTS, NEW     CHANNELS, AND INCREASINGLY, NEW MARKETS TO THE AGREEMENTS. THIS     PAST YEAR, AMONG OTHER NEW PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS, WE ANNOUNCED OR     LAUNCHED SEVERAL NEW CO-BRANDED PRODUCTS IN THE INTERNATIONAL     CONSUMER BUSINESS, INCLUDING: A NEW PLATINUM CO-BRAND CARD IN     PARTNERSHIP WITH AIR NEW ZEALAND, NEW ZEALAND\\x92S NATIONAL     AIR CARRIER; A CO-BRAND CARD PROGRAM WITH SOL MELIA, A LUXURY     HOTEL AND RESORT CHAIN BASED IN SPAIN; AND THE NEW STARWOOD     PREFERRED GUEST CREDIT CARD FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS IN THE UNITED     KINGDOM AND CANADA, OFFERING CARDMEMBERS AND STARWOOD PREFERRED     GUESTS PROGRAM LOYALISTS THE OPPORTUNITY TO EARN STARPOINTS ON     VIRTUALLY ALL OF THEIR CARD SPENDING. WE OFFER MANY OF THE SAME     PROGRAMS AND SERVICES IN OUR INTERNATIONAL PROPRIETARY     CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS AS WE DO IN OUR U.S. PROPRIETARY     ISSUING BUSINESS. FOR EXAMPLE, AS IN THE UNITED STATES, WE OFFER     VARIOUS FLEXIBLE PAYMENT OPTIONS SIMILAR TO OUR SIGN &     TRAVEL®      PROGRAM AND OUR EXTENDED PAYMENT OPTION TO CARDMEMBERS IN     SEVERAL COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE U.S. ALSO, AS IN THE UNITED     STATES, WE ISSUE CARDS INTERNATIONALLY UNDER DISTRIBUTION     AGREEMENTS WITH FINANCIAL SERVICES INSTITUTIONS. ANOTHER EXAMPLE     OF OUR DISTRIBUTION PARTNERSHIPS IS AFFINITY CARDS WITH     FRATERNAL, PROFESSIONAL, EDUCATIONAL AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS.     FOR INSTANCE, WE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN PENETRATING THE     AFFINITY CARD SEGMENT IN AUSTRALIA, WHERE WE ISSUE CARDS WITH     THE MAJORITY OF THE LARGEST PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS IN THAT     COUNTRY. IN AUSTRALIA, AFFINITY CARDS ARE A SUBSTANTIAL PART OF     OUR TOTAL REVOLVING PORTFOLIO AND CONTRIBUTE TO OUR PROPRIETARY     CONSUMER LENDING ACTIVITIES.         AS IN THE UNITED STATES, THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAMS ARE A     STRONG DRIVER OF CARDMEMBER SPENDING IN THE INTERNATIONAL     CONSUMER BUSINESS. WE HAVE MORE THAN 1,500 REDEMPTION PARTNERS     ACROSS OUR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS, WITH AN AVERAGE OF     APPROXIMATELY 84 PARTNERS IN EACH COUNTRY; APPROXIMATELY 30% OF     THESE PARTNERS ARE IN THE TRAVEL INDUSTRY. CARDMEMBERS CAN     REDEEM THEIR POINTS WITH MORE THAN 40 AIRLINES AND OVER 175     HOTELS. OUR REDEMPTION OPTIONS INCLUDE TRAVEL, RETAIL     MERCHANDISE, ENTERTAINMENT, SHOPPING AND RECREATION GIFT     CERTIFICATES, EXPERIENCES, FINANCIAL SERVICES AND CHARITY     REWARDS. IN 2010, WE CONTINUED TO ENHANCE OUR REWARDS PROGRAMS     IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES, OFFERING MORE FLEXIBLE CHOICES THAT ENABLE     CARDMEMBERS TO REDEEM MEMBERSHIP REWARDS POINTS MORE QUICKLY.         WE CONTINUE TO BUILD ON THE COMPANY\\x92S STRENGTHS AND LOOK     FOR FURTHER OPPORTUNITIES TO INCREASE OUR PRESENCE     INTERNATIONALLY. IN DECEMBER 2010, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE ENTERED     INTO AN AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE LOYALTY PARTNER, A LEADING     MARKETING SERVICES COMPANY KNOWN FOR THE LOYALTY PROGRAMS IT     OPERATES IN GERMANY, POLAND AND INDIA. LOYALTY PARTNER ALSO     PROVIDES ANALYTICS, OPERATING PLATFORMS AND CONSULTING SERVICES     THAT HELP MERCHANTS GROW THEIR BUSINESSES. THE ACQUISITION WILL     DEEPEN OUR MERCHANT RELATIONSHIPS IN SELECT COUNTRIES, ADD MORE     THAN 34 MILLION CONSUMERS TO THE COMPANY\\x92S     INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMER BASE AND EXPAND ITS RANGE OF REWARDS AND     LOYALTY MARKETING SERVICES. THE ACQUISITION IS PART OF THE     COMPANY\\x92S DRIVE TO BUILD AND DIVERSIFY ITS FEE SERVICE     REVENUES AND EXPAND ITS INTERNATIONAL PRESENCE. THE PURCHASE,     WHICH HAS RECEIVED REGULATORY APPROVAL, IS EXPECTED TO CLOSE IN     THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011. THE TRANSACTION, WHICH VALUES THE     COMPANY AT $660 MILLION (SUBJECT TO CURRENCY MOVEMENT AND     OTHER ADJUSTMENTS), CONSISTS OF AN UPFRONT CASH PURCHASE PRICE     OF $566 MILLION AND AN ADDITIONAL $94 MILLION EQUITY     INTEREST THAT THE COMPANY WILL ACQUIRE OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS     AT A VALUE BASED ON BUSINESS PERFORMANCE.         MEMBERSHIP TRAVEL SERVICES INTERNATIONAL PROVIDES PREMIUM TRAVEL     AND CONCIERGE SERVICES TO OUR PLATINUM AND CENTURION CUSTOMERS,     THROUGH 24 EXCLUSIVELY DEDICATED CALL CENTERS IN 23     INTERNATIONAL COUNTRIES. ADDITIONALLY, MEMBERSHIP TRAVEL     SERVICES OPERATES 16 PROPRIETARY TRAVEL SERVICE OFFICES IN     MEXICO, ITALY AND ARGENTINA TO PROVIDE ALL CARDMEMBERS WITH     TRAVEL AND GENERAL CARD SERVICE ASSISTANCE. WE ALSO PROVIDE TO     OUR CARDMEMBERS CERTAIN FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRAVELERS CHEQUE     SERVICES AND OTHER CARDMEMBER-RELATED SERVICES IN TRAVEL SERVICE     OFFICES IN MEXICO, ARGENTINA AND ITALY. WE HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO     ENHANCE OUR CAPABILITIES TO SELL          28    TABLE OF CONTENTS        EXCLUSIVELY NEGOTIATED BENEFITS AND LUXURY TRAVEL PACKAGES WITH     PREFERRED SUPPLIERS THROUGH THE FINE HOTELS & RESORTS     PROGRAM, AMERICAN EXPRESS VACATIONS AND AMERICAN EXPRESS\\x92     INTERNATIONAL AIRLINE PROGRAM. OUR INTERNATIONAL AIRLINE     PROGRAM, WHICH IS EXCLUSIVELY AVAILABLE TO PLATINUM CARD AND     CENTURION CARDMEMBERS, ALLOWS THESE CARDMEMBERS TO RECEIVE     COMPLIMENTARY COMPANION TICKETS OR A CLASS UPGRADE WHEN FLYING     ON QUALIFYING INTERNATIONAL FLIGHTS IN BUSINESS OR FIRST CLASS.         WE EXPANDED THE FLEXIBILITY OF PAYMENT FOR TRAVEL AND CONCIERGE     SERVICES BY ALLOWING INTERNATIONAL CONSUMER CARDMEMBERS TO USE     THEIR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS POINTS TO PAY FOR THEIR TRAVEL     PURCHASES IN 15 COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE U.S.     INTERNATIONAL     PROPRIETARY CONSUMER CARD \\x97 COMPETITION         COMPARED TO THE UNITED STATES, CONSUMERS OUTSIDE THE UNITED     STATES USE GENERAL-PURPOSE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS FOR A SMALLER     PERCENTAGE OF THEIR TOTAL PAYMENTS, WITH SOME LARGE EMERGING     MARKET COUNTRIES JUST BEGINNING TO TRANSITION TO CARD USAGE IN     ANY MEANINGFUL WAY. ALTHOUGH OUR GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE IS WIDESPREAD,     WE GENERALLY DO NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT SHARE IN THE COUNTRIES IN     WHICH WE OPERATE INTERNATIONALLY. OUR PROPRIETARY CARD-ISSUING     BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO COMPETITION FROM MULTINATIONAL BANKS,     SUCH AS CITIBANK, HSBC AND BANCO SANTANDER, AS WELL AS MANY     LOCAL BANKS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. GLOBALLY, WE VIEW     CITIBANK AND BANCO SANTANDER AS OUR STRONGEST COMPETITORS, AS     THEY CURRENTLY OFFER CARD PRODUCTS IN A LARGE NUMBER OF     COUNTRIES.     INTERNATIONAL     PROPRIETARY CONSUMER CARD \\x97 REGULATION         AS DISCUSSED ELSEWHERE IN THIS     FORM 10-K,     REGULATORS IN 2010 CONTINUED TO PROPOSE AND ENACT A VARIETY OF     REGULATORY CHANGES TO THE PAYMENTS LANDSCAPE IN MANY OF OUR KEY     COUNTRIES. WE EXPECT THIS ACTIVITY TO CONTINUE IN 2011.     REGULATORS CONTINUE TO CONSIDER DEVELOPMENTS IN THE UNITED     STATES AND OTHER JURISDICTIONS TO HELP INFORM THEIR POLICY.     WHILE THE NATURE OF THE PROPOSALS VARIES, REGULATORS IN A NUMBER     OF COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN FOCUSED ON PRICING, DISCLOSURE,     RESPONSIBLE LENDING AND OTHER CARD PRACTICES AND WE EXPECT THIS     TO CONTINUE IN 2011. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE UNITED KINGDOM THE     GOVERNMENT ADOPTED A NEW POLICY BY WAY OF A \\x93WHITE     PAPER\\x94 SETTING OUT SEVERAL REQUIREMENTS AROUND CARD     PRACTICES. IN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA, MEMBER STATES HAVE     IMPLEMENTED OR ARE IN THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING EUROPEAN     DIRECTIVE 2008/48/EC ON CREDIT AGREEMENTS FOR CONSUMERS     (COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE CONSUMER CREDIT DIRECTIVE), WHICH     IN SOME COUNTRIES WILL HAVE IMPACTS ON CHARGE CARDS IN ADDITION     TO CREDIT CARDS. MEMBER STATES HAVE ALSO IMPLEMENTED THE PAYMENT     SERVICES DIRECTIVE, WHICH REGULATES THE CONDUCT OF BUSINESS OF     PAYMENT SERVICE PROVIDERS, INCLUDING CARD ISSUERS.         AS A CONSEQUENCE, THESE AND PERHAPS OTHER REGULATORS MAY     CONSIDER AND IMPLEMENT ADDITIONAL CARD PRACTICE REGULATION IN     2011. WE CONTINUE TO EVALUATE OUR BUSINESS PLANNING IN LIGHT OF     CHANGING MARKET CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE EVOLVING POLITICAL,     ECONOMIC, REGULATORY AND MEDIA ENVIRONMENT.      GLOBAL     COMMERCIAL SERVICES          IN OUR GLOBAL COMMERCIAL SERVICES (\\x93GCS\\x94) SEGMENT, WE     PROVIDE EXPENSE MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO COMPANIES AND     ORGANIZATIONS WORLDWIDE THROUGH GLOBAL COMMERCIAL CARD AND     GLOBAL BUSINESS TRAVEL SERVICES.

WE ALSO CONTINUED TO ENHANCE OUR     EXISTING CO-BRAND PORTFOLIOS THROUGH THE LAUNCH OF THE AMERICAN     EXPRESS® / BUSINESS      EXTRAA®      CORPORATE PLATINUM CARD IN THE UNITED STATES IN 2010.         30    TABLE OF CONTENTS    BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS     PAYMENT SOLUTIONS         WE ALSO OFFER A SERIES OF     BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS     PAYMENT SOLUTIONS TO HELP COMPANIES MANAGE B2B SPENDING.

BUSINESSES OF THIS SIZE OFTEN     DO NOT HAVE A CORPORATE CARD PROGRAM. HOWEVER, ONCE ENROLLED,     MID-SIZED COMPANIES TYPICALLY PUT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THEIR     BUSINESS SPENDING ON THE CORPORATE CARD BECAUSE THEY CAN GAIN     CONTROL, SAVINGS AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.

MOREOVER, IN THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, THE     INTEREST IN EXPENSE MANAGEMENT TOOLS IS PARTICULARLY STRONG, AS     CLIENTS AIM TO CAPTURE DATA, ANALYZE TRENDS AND MAKE DECISIONS     THAT ENHANCE THEIR CASH FLOW AND PROFITABILITY. COMMERCIAL CARD     ISSUERS HAVE INCREASINGLY ACQUIRED TECHNOLOGY OFFERINGS TO     ENHANCE DATA CAPTURE CAPABILITIES AND REPORTING FUNCTIONALITY.     IN ADDITION, MANY ISSUERS ATTEMPT TO LEVERAGE THEIR BANKING     RELATIONSHIPS AND CAPABILITIES TO SECURE AND RETAIN CARD     BUSINESS. GLOBAL SERVICING, DATA QUALITY, TECHNOLOGICAL     FUNCTIONALITY AND SIMPLICITY, CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE, AND PRICE AND     OTHER FINANCIAL TERMS ARE AMONG THE KEY COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN     THE COMMERCIAL CARD BUSINESS.

FOR     EXAMPLE, WE HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED OUR RELIANCE ON     COMMISSION REVENUES FROM SUPPLIERS (SUCH AS AIRLINES OR HOTELS),     AND NOW GENERATE REVENUES PRIMARILY FROM CUSTOMERS WHO PAY FOR     THE SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE.

GLOBAL BUSINESS TRAVEL HAS MOVED     MANY OF ITS BUSINESS PROCESSES AND CUSTOMER SERVICING ONLINE. IN     THE UNITED STATES, APPROXIMATELY 57.5% OF ALL GLOBAL BUSINESS     TRAVEL TRANSACTIONS CONTINUE TO BE PROCESSED ONLINE. IN     ADDITION, THE VOLUME OF ONLINE TRANSACTIONS IS GROWING IN OTHER     COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD.     GLOBAL     BUSINESS TRAVEL \\x97 COMPETITION         GLOBAL BUSINESS TRAVEL CONTINUES TO FACE INTENSE COMPETITION IN     THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY FROM NUMEROUS TRADITIONAL     AND ONLINE TRAVEL MANAGEMENT COMPANIES, AS WELL AS FROM DIRECT     SALES BY AIRLINES AND OTHER TRAVEL SUPPLIERS. COMPETITION AMONG     TRAVEL MANAGEMENT COMPANIES IS MAINLY BASED ON PRICE, SERVICE,     VALUE CREATION, CONVENIENCE, GLOBAL CAPABILITIES AND PROXIMITY     TO THE CUSTOMER. COMPETITION ALSO COMES FROM CORPORATE CUSTOMERS     THEMSELVES, AS SOME COMPANIES HAVE BECOME ACCREDITED AS IN-HOUSE     CORPORATE TRAVEL AGENTS. NEW ENTRANTS COULD ALSO REPRESENT     ADDITIONAL COMPETITION ALONG THE END TO END TRAVEL VALUE CHAIN,     WHICH COULD IMPACT COMPETITION IN THE MEDIUM TO LONG TERM.         FOR MANY YEARS, TRAVEL MANAGEMENT COMPANIES HAVE FACED PRESSURE     ON REVENUES FROM AIRLINES, AS MOST CARRIERS HAVE STOPPED PAYING     \\x93BASE\\x94 COMMISSIONS TO TRAVEL AGENTS FOR TICKETS SOLD     AND SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED OTHER FORMS OF TRAVEL AGENT     COMPENSATION. CARRIERS HAVE ALSO INCREASED THE NUMBER OF     TRANSACTIONS THEY BOOK DIRECTLY THROUGH THEIR WEB SITES AND     OTHER MEANS. THESE TRENDS HAVE REDUCED THE REVENUE OPPORTUNITIES     FOR TRAVEL MANAGEMENT COMPANIES BECAUSE THEY DO NOT RECEIVE     DISTRIBUTION REVENUE FROM DIRECTLY BOOKED TRANSACTIONS. IN     RECENT YEARS, THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY HAS UNDERGONE BANKRUPTCIES,     RESTRUCTURINGS, CONSOLIDATIONS AND OTHER SIMILAR EVENTS     INCLUDING EXPANDED GRANTS OF ANTITRUST IMMUNITY TO AIRLINE     ALLIANCES. THIS IMMUNITY ENABLES AIRLINES TO CLOSELY COORDINATE     THEIR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TO LAUNCH HIGHLY INTEGRATED     JOINT VENTURES IN TRANSATLANTIC AND OTHER MARKETS. THESE TYPES     OF STRUCTURAL CHANGES MAY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES TO     TRAVEL MANAGEMENT COMPANIES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION     CONCERNING THESE ISSUES, PLEASE SEE \\x93RISK     FACTORS \\x97 WE HAVE AGREEMENTS WITH BUSINESS PARTNERS     IN A VARIETY OF INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY, THAT     REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS\\x94 ON     PAGE 87 BELOW.         OVERALL, INTENSE COMPETITION AMONG TRAVEL MANAGEMENT COMPANIES,     THE ONGOING TRENDS OF INCREASING DIRECT SALES BY AIRLINES, THE     RISE OF LOW-COST CARRIERS AND ONGOING REDUCTIONS IN OR     ELIMINATION OF AIRLINE COMMISSIONS AND FEES, CONTINUE TO PUT     PRESSURE ON REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY FOR TRAVEL AGENTS.         OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS WE HAVE EVOLVED OUR BUSINESS MODEL TO     PERMIT US TO CHARGE CUSTOMERS FOR THE SERVICES WE PROVIDE AND     THE VALUE WE CREATE, AND RESTRUCTURED OUR EXPENSE BASE THROUGH     THE RATIONALIZATION OF OUR CALL CENTER LOCATIONS AND THE     TRANSITIONING OF MANY OF OUR SERVICES ONLINE. WE CONTINUE TO     LOOK FOR NEW WAYS TO ENHANCE THE VALUE WE DELIVER FOR OUR     CUSTOMERS BOTH ONLINE AND OFFLINE. ADDITIONALLY, WE ARE FOCUSING     ON DEVELOPING NEW AND INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND     TECHNOLOGIES, WHICH ENHANCE THE VALUE WE DELIVER TO OUR     CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS AND ADDRESS ONGOING TRAVEL INDUSTRY     CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES.

THESE     LAWS REQUIRE TRAVELERS CHEQUE (AND, WHERE APPLICABLE, PREPAID     CARD) ISSUERS, AS WELL AS PROVIDERS OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE     SERVICES, TO OBTAIN LICENSES, TO MEET CERTAIN SAFETY AND     SOUNDNESS CRITERIA, TO HOLD OUTSTANDING PROCEEDS OF SALE IN     HIGHLY RATED AND SECURE INVESTMENTS, AND TO PROVIDE DETAILED     REPORTS. WE INVEST THE PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF OUR TRAVELERS     CHEQUES AND PREPAID CARDS IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW,     PREDOMINANTLY IN HIGHLY RATED DEBT SECURITIES CONSISTING     PRIMARILY OF INTERMEDIATE- AND LONG-TERM FEDERAL, STATE AND     MUNICIPAL OBLIGATIONS. MANY STATES EXAMINE LICENSEES ANNUALLY.         IN ADDITION, FEDERAL ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING REGULATIONS REQUIRE,     AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE REGISTRATION OF TRAVELER CHEQUE ISSUERS     AND THE PROVIDERS OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE SERVICES AS \\x93MONEY     SERVICE BUSINESSES\\x94 AND COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE     ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING RECORDKEEPING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.     OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THERE ARE VARYING LICENSING AND     ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING SOME THAT ARE     SIMILAR TO THOSE IN THE UNITED STATES.         TRAVELERS CHEQUE ISSUERS ARE REQUIRED BY THE LAWS OF MANY STATES     TO COMPLY WITH STATE UNCLAIMED AND ABANDONED PROPERTY LAWS UNDER     WHICH SUCH ISSUERS MUST PAY TO STATES THE FACE AMOUNT OF ANY     TRAVELERS CHEQUE THAT IS UNCASHED OR UNREDEEMED AFTER A PERIOD     OF TIME, USUALLY 15 YEARS. THE ABANDONED PROPERTY LAWS OF     NUMEROUS STATES ALSO APPLY TO PREPAID CARDS IN A VARIETY OF WAYS.         IN MAY 2009, THE CARD ACT AMENDED PROVISIONS OF THE ELECTRONIC     FUNDS TRANSFER ACT TO IMPOSE NEW RESTRICTIONS ON THE TERMS OF     GIFT CARDS AND CERTAIN OTHER PREPAID CARDS, INCLUDING     RESTRICTIONS ON THE FEES THAT MAY BE CHARGED, EXPIRATION DATES,     AND CONSUMER DISCLOSURES. THE FEDERAL RESERVE ISSUED FINAL     REGULATIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE CARD ACT GIFT CARD PROVISIONS THAT     BECAME EFFECTIVE IN AUGUST 2010. CONGRESS THEREAFTER PASSED     LEGISLATION THAT EXTENDED THE AUGUST 2010 EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE     CARD ACT GIFT CARD PROVISIONS TO JANUARY 2011 FOR GIFT CARDS     PRODUCED PRIOR TO APRIL 1, 2010, PROVIDED CERTAIN     CONDITIONS ARE MET. WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR STATE LEGISLATIVE     ACTIVITY RESTRICTING THE TERMS OF GIFT CARDS. IN CERTAIN STATES     WHERE REGULATION CONTINUES TO RESTRICT FEES AND HAS MADE IT     UNPROFITABLE FOR US TO OFFER GIFT CARDS, WE HAVE LIMITED OR     WITHDRAWN FROM SELLING THESE CARDS.         IN JUNE 2010, THE FINANCIAL CRIMES ENFORCEMENT NETWORK, AN     ENFORCEMENT AGENCY OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY,     ISSUED A NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULE MAKING THAT PROPOSES A     NUMBER OF CHANGES TO ITS REGULATION OF THE PREPAID INDUSTRY. IN     GENERAL, THE PROPOSED RULE REDEFINES THE TERM \\x93STORED     VALUE\\x94 MORE BROADLY AND RENAMES THIS GROUP OF PRODUCTS     \\x93PREPAID ACCESS.\\x94 THE THREE TRADITIONAL CATEGORIES OF     STORED VALUE PARTICIPANTS, \\x93ISSUERS, SELLERS AND REDEEMERS     OF STORED VALUE,\\x94 ARE NOW CONSOLIDATED INTO TWO GROUPS,     \\x93PROVIDERS AND SELLERS OF PREPAID ACCESS.\\x94 WITH     LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, THE PROPOSED RULE IMPOSES SUSPICIOUS     ACTIVITY REPORTING, CUSTOMER IDENTIFICATION, AND RECORD KEEPING     REQUIREMENTS ON THE TWO NEWLY DEFINED GROUPS, WHICH COULD MEAN     NON-BANK PROGRAM MANAGERS AND RETAILERS WOULD HAVE TO DEVELOP     AND MAINTAIN AML PROGRAMS THAT WERE NOT PREVIOUSLY REQUIRED. THE     PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD FOR THE PROPOSED RULE CLOSED ON     AUGUST 27, 2010. WE ARE AWAITING ISSUANCE OF THE FINAL RULE     AND WILL ANALYZE ITS IMPACT ON OUR CURRENT PRODUCTS ONCE THE     FINAL RULE IS ISSUED.

CERTAIN     OF OUR PUBLIC DISCLOSURE, INTERNAL CONTROL ENVIRONMENT AND     CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES ARE SUBJECT TO THE     SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002 (\\x93SARBANES-OXLEY\\x94) AND     RELATED REGULATIONS AND RULES OF THE SEC AND THE NEW YORK STOCK     EXCHANGE, INC. AS A GLOBAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, TO THE EXTENT     THAT DIFFERENT REGULATORY SYSTEMS IMPOSE OVERLAPPING OR     INCONSISTENT REQUIREMENTS ON THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS, WE     FACE COMPLEXITY AND ADDITIONAL COSTS IN OUR COMPLIANCE EFFORTS.     THE     DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION     ACT         DODD-FRANK, WHICH WAS ENACTED IN JULY 2010, SIGNIFICANTLY     RESTRUCTURES THE FINANCIAL REGULATORY REGIME IN THE UNITED     STATES, INCLUDING THROUGH THE CREATION OF A NEW SYSTEMIC RISK     OVERSIGHT BODY, THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OVERSIGHT COUNCIL     (\\x93FSOC\\x94). THE FSOC WILL OVERSEE AND COORDINATE THE     EFFORTS OF THE PRIMARY U.S. FINANCIAL REGULATORY AGENCIES     (INCLUDING THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE SEC, THE U.S. COMMODITY     FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION, THE OCC AND THE FDIC) IN     ESTABLISHING REGULATIONS TO ADDRESS FINANCIAL STABILITY     CONCERNS. DODD-FRANK DIRECTS THE FSOC TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO     THE FEDERAL RESERVE AS TO SUPERVISORY REQUIREMENTS AND     PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS APPLICABLE TO BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH     $50 BILLION OR MORE IN TOTAL CONSOLIDATED          38    TABLE OF CONTENTS        ASSETS, WHICH INCLUDES THE COMPANY, AND OTHER SYSTEMICALLY     IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THE STANDARDS INCLUDE CAPITAL,     LEVERAGE, LIQUIDITY AND RISK-MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS. DODD-FRANK     MANDATES THAT THE REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO SYSTEMICALLY     IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS BE MORE STRINGENT THAN THOSE     APPLICABLE TO OTHER FINANCIAL COMPANIES.         IN ADDITION TO THE FRAMEWORK FOR SYSTEMIC RISK OVERSIGHT     IMPLEMENTED THROUGH THE FSOC, DODD-FRANK BROADLY AFFECTS THE     FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY IN NUMEROUS RESPECTS, INCLUDING BY     CREATING A RESOLUTION AUTHORITY, BY REQUIRING BANKS TO PAY     INCREASED FEES TO REGULATORY AGENCIES, BY REQUIRING ALL PUBLICLY     TRADED BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT HAVE ASSETS OF AT LEAST     $10 BILLION TO ESTABLISH A RISK COMMITTEE (INCLUDING     INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS) RESPONSIBLE FOR ENTERPRISE-WIDE RISK     MANAGEMENT OVERSIGHT AND PRACTICES, AND THROUGH NUMEROUS OTHER     PROVISIONS AIMED AT STRENGTHENING THE SOUND OPERATION OF THE     FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR. MOREOVER, TITLE X OF DODD-FRANK,     KNOWN AS THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION ACT OF 2010 (THE     \\x93CFPA\\x94), PROVIDES FOR THE CREATION OF THE CONSUMER     FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU, A NEW CONSUMER FINANCIAL SERVICES     REGULATOR, DISCUSSED BELOW UNDER \\x93CONSUMER FINANCIAL     PROTECTION ACT OF 2010.\\x94 NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR CHANGES     TO EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS (INCLUDING CHANGES IN     INTERPRETATION OR ENFORCEMENT) COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT     OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. AS DISCUSSED     FURTHER THROUGHOUT THIS SECTION, MANY ASPECTS OF DODD-FRANK ARE     SUBJECT TO FURTHER RULEMAKING AND WILL TAKE EFFECT OVER SEVERAL     YEARS, MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO ANTICIPATE THE OVERALL FINANCIAL     IMPACT ON THE COMPANY OR ACROSS THE INDUSTRY. IN ADDITION TO THE     DISCUSSION IN THIS SECTION, PLEASE SEE \\x93RISK     FACTORS \\x97 THE DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND     CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT MAY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE IMPACT ON     OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL     CONDITION\\x94 ON PAGES 77-78 AND \\x93RISK     FACTORS \\x97 BANKS, CARD ISSUERS AND CARD NETWORK     OPERATORS GENERALLY ARE THE SUBJECT OF INCREASING GLOBAL     REGULATORY FOCUS, WHICH MAY IMPOSE COSTLY NEW COMPLIANCE BURDENS     ON OUR COMPANY AND LEAD TO DECREASED TRANSACTION VOLUMES AND     REVENUES THROUGH OUR NETWORK\\x94 ON PAGES 80-82 FOR A     FURTHER DISCUSSION OF SOME OF THE POTENTIAL IMPACT LEGISLATIVE     AND REGULATORY CHANGES MAY HAVE ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND     FINANCIAL CONDITION.     CONSUMER     FINANCIAL PROTECTION ACT OF 2010         AS MENTIONED ABOVE, THE CFPA PROVIDES FOR THE CREATION OF THE     CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU (THE \\x93BUREAU\\x94), A     NEW CONSUMER FINANCIAL SERVICES REGULATOR. AS OF JULY 21,     2011, BUT SUBJECT TO A POSSIBLE SIX-MONTH EXTENSION, OUR     MARKETING AND SALE OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND OUR     COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN FEDERAL CONSUMER FINANCIAL LAWS,     INCLUDING THE CFPA AND THE TRUTH IN LENDING ACT, WILL BE     SUPERVISED AND EXAMINED BY THE BUREAU. ON THAT DATE, THE BUREAU     WILL ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FROM OUR CURRENT BANKING REGULATORS     FOR SUPERVISION AND EXAMINATION OF CENTURION BANK, AEBFSB, AND     THEIR AFFILIATES, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, WITH RESPECT TO SUCH     FEDERAL CONSUMER FINANCIAL LAWS. THE BUREAU WILL HAVE AUTHORITY     TO TAKE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AGAINST US FOR VIOLATION OF THOSE     LAWS AND ALSO WILL HAVE EXCLUSIVE RULEMAKING AUTHORITY FOR SUCH     FEDERAL CONSUMER FINANCIAL LAWS. IN THE INTERIM, THE FEDERAL     BANKING AGENCIES HAVE BEEN VIGOROUSLY ENFORCING CONSUMER     PROTECTION LAWS.         THE BUREAU ALSO WILL BE DIRECTED TO PROHIBIT \\x93UNFAIR,     DECEPTIVE OR ABUSIVE\\x94 ACTS AND PRACTICES AND TO ENSURE THAT     ALL CONSUMERS HAVE ACCESS TO MARKETS FOR CONSUMER FINANCIAL     PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND THAT SUCH MARKETS ARE FAIR,     TRANSPARENT AND COMPETITIVE. THE NEW LEGISLATION ALSO WEAKENS     FEDERAL PREEMPTION AVAILABLE TO FEDERAL SAVINGS ASSOCIATIONS,     INCLUDING AEBFSB, AND GIVES STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL THE ABILITY     TO ENFORCE APPLICABLE FEDERAL CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS.     FINANCIAL     HOLDING COMPANY STATUS AND ACTIVITIES         THE BHC ACT LIMITS THE NONBANKING ACTIVITIES OF BANK HOLDING     COMPANIES. UNLESS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY HAS QUALIFIED AS A     \\x93FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY,\\x94 ITS NONBANKING ACTIVITIES     ARE RESTRICTED TO THOSE THAT THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS DETERMINED     ARE \\x93SO CLOSELY RELATED TO BANKING AS TO BE A PROPER     INCIDENT THERETO.\\x94 AN ELIGIBLE BANK HOLDING COMPANY MAY     ELECT TO BE A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY, WHICH IS AUTHORIZED TO     ENGAGE IN A BROADER RANGE OF FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES. A FINANCIAL     HOLDING COMPANY MAY ENGAGE IN ANY ACTIVITY THAT HAS BEEN     DETERMINED BY RULE OR ORDER TO BE FINANCIAL IN NATURE,     INCIDENTAL TO SUCH FINANCIAL ACTIVITY, OR (WITH PRIOR FEDERAL     RESERVE APPROVAL) COMPLEMENTARY TO A FINANCIAL ACTIVITY AND THAT     DOES NOT POSE A SUBSTANTIAL RISK TO THE SAFETY OR SOUNDNESS OF A     DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION OR TO THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM GENERALLY.     AMERICAN EXPRESS          39    TABLE OF CONTENTS        ENGAGES IN VARIOUS ACTIVITIES PERMISSIBLE ONLY FOR A BANK     HOLDING COMPANY THAT HAS ELECTED TO BE TREATED AS A FINANCIAL     HOLDING COMPANY, INCLUDING IN PARTICULAR PROVIDING TRAVEL AGENCY     SERVICES, ACTING AS A FINDER AND ENGAGING IN CERTAIN INSURANCE     UNDERWRITING AND AGENCY SERVICES.         FOR A BANK HOLDING COMPANY TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL HOLDING     COMPANY STATUS, EACH OF ITS SUBSIDIARY U.S. DEPOSITORY     INSTITUTIONS MUST BE \\x93WELL CAPITALIZED\\x94 AND \\x93WELL     MANAGED\\x94 AND MUST HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST A SATISFACTORY     RATING ON ITS MOST RECENT COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT OF 1977     (THE \\x93CRA\\x94) REVIEW. PURSUANT TO DODD-FRANK, BEGINNING     JULY 21, 2011, BUT SUBJECT TO A POSSIBLE SIX-MONTH     EXTENSION, TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY STATUS,     THE COMPANY AND TRS ALSO MUST BE AND REMAIN WELL CAPITALIZED AND     WELL MANAGED. IF THE COMPANY FAILS TO CONTINUE TO MEET     APPLICABLE CAPITAL OR MANAGERIAL STANDARDS FOR FINANCIAL HOLDING     COMPANY STATUS, THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO ENTER INTO AN     AGREEMENT WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE     CAPITAL AND MANAGERIAL STANDARDS. MOREOVER, UNTIL ALL RELEVANT     CONDITIONS ARE SATISFIED, THE COMPANY, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND     AFFILIATES WOULD NOT, WITHOUT THE FEDERAL RESERVE\\x92S PRIOR     APPROVAL, BE PERMITTED TO COMMENCE ANY ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES, OR     ACQUIRE CONTROL OR SHARES OF ANY COMPANY, IN RELIANCE ON THE     COMPANY\\x92S STATUS AS A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY, AND THE     COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH ANY ADDITIONAL     LIMITATIONS THAT THE FEDERAL RESERVE IMPOSES. IF A COMPANY DOES     NOT RETURN TO COMPLIANCE WITHIN 180 DAYS, THE FEDERAL     RESERVE MAY ORDER THE COMPANY TO DIVEST ITS SUBSIDIARY     U.S. DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS OR THE COMPANY MAY DISCONTINUE     OR DIVEST INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES ENGAGED IN ACTIVITIES     PERMISSIBLE ONLY FOR A BANK HOLDING COMPANY THAT HAS ELECTED TO     BE TREATED AS A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY. IN ADDITION, IF ANY     SUBSIDIARY U.S. DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION FAILS TO MAINTAIN A     SATISFACTORY RATING UNDER THE CRA, AMERICAN EXPRESS WOULD BE     SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME RESTRICTIONS ON ACTIVITIES AND     ACQUISITIONS AS SET FORTH ABOVE.         PLEASE SEE \\x93OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT AND     EXTENSIVE GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND SUPERVISION WHICH COULD     ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL     CONDITION\\x94 IN \\x93ITEM 1A\\x97RISK     FACTORS\\x94 BELOW.     HEIGHTENED     PRUDENTIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR LARGE BANK HOLDING     COMPANIES         AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, DODD-FRANK CREATES A NEW SYSTEMIC RISK     OVERSIGHT BODY, THE FSOC, TO IDENTIFY, MONITOR AND ADDRESS     POTENTIAL THREATS TO U.S. FINANCIAL STABILITY.     ADDITIONALLY, DODD-FRANK IMPOSES HEIGHTENED PRUDENTIAL     REQUIREMENTS ON BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH AT LEAST     $50 BILLION IN TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS, INCLUDING THE     COMPANY, AND REQUIRES THE FEDERAL RESERVE TO ESTABLISH     PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS FOR SUCH LARGE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT     ARE MORE STRINGENT THAN THOSE APPLICABLE TO OTHER BANK HOLDING     COMPANIES, INCLUDING STANDARDS FOR RISK-BASED CAPITAL     REQUIREMENTS AND LEVERAGE LIMITS, LIQUIDITY, RISK-MANAGEMENT     REQUIREMENTS, RESOLUTION PLANS (REFERRED TO AS \\x93LIVING     WILLS\\x94), CREDIT EXPOSURE REPORTING, AND CONCENTRATION. THE     FEDERAL RESERVE HAS DISCRETIONARY AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH     ADDITIONAL PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS, ON ITS OWN OR AT THE     FSOC\\x92S RECOMMENDATION, REGARDING CONTINGENT CAPITAL,     ENHANCED PUBLIC DISCLOSURES, SHORT-TERM DEBT LIMITS AND     OTHERWISE AS IT DEEMS APPROPRIATE.         DODD-FRANK REQUIRES THE FEDERAL RESERVE TO CONDUCT ANNUAL     ANALYSES OF BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH AT LEAST     $50 BILLION IN TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS TO EVALUATE     WHETHER THE COMPANIES HAVE SUFFICIENT CAPITAL ON A TOTAL     CONSOLIDATED BASIS NECESSARY TO ABSORB LOSSES AS A RESULT OF     ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. IN ADDITION, SUCH LARGE BANK     HOLDING COMPANIES, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, MUST CONDUCT SIMILAR     SO-CALLED \\x93STRESS TESTS\\x94 ON A SEMIANNUAL BASIS.     FURTHERMORE, SUCH LARGE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES MAY BE REQUIRED     TO MAINTAIN A     DEBT-TO-EQUITY     RATIO OF NO MORE THAN 15 TO 1 UPON A DETERMINATION BY THE FSOC     THAT THE COMPANY POSES A GRAVE THREAT TO THE FINANCIAL STABILITY     OF THE U.S. AND THE IMPOSITION OF SUCH REQUIREMENT IS     NECESSARY TO MITIGATE THE POSED THREAT.         AS NOTED ABOVE, DODD-FRANK WILL REQUIRE US TO PREPARE AND     PROVIDE TO REGULATORS A RESOLUTION PLAN THAT MUST, AMONG OTHER     THINGS, ENSURE THAT OUR DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES ARE     ADEQUATELY PROTECTED FROM RISKS ARISING FROM OUR OTHER     SUBSIDIARIES. THE ESTABLISHMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF THIS     RESOLUTION PLAN MAY, AS A PRACTICAL MATTER, PRESENT ADDITIONAL     CONSTRAINTS ON TRANSACTIONS AND BUSINESS ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN     OUR BANK AND NON-BANK SUBSIDIARIES.         40    TABLE OF CONTENTS    ACTIVITIES     AND ACQUISITIONS         THE BHC ACT REQUIRES A BANK HOLDING COMPANY TO OBTAIN THE PRIOR     APPROVAL OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BEFORE: (1) IT MAY ACQUIRE     DIRECT OR INDIRECT OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL OF ANY VOTING SHARES OF     ANY BANK OR SAVINGS AND LOAN ASSOCIATION, IF AFTER SUCH     ACQUISITION, THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY WILL DIRECTLY OR     INDIRECTLY OWN OR CONTROL MORE THAN 5% OF ANY CLASS OF THE     VOTING SECURITIES OF THE INSTITUTION; (2) IT OR ANY OF ITS     SUBSIDIARIES, OTHER THAN A BANK, MAY ACQUIRE ALL OR     SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS OF ANY BANK OR SAVINGS AND LOAN     ASSOCIATION; OR (3) IT MAY MERGE OR CONSOLIDATE WITH ANY     OTHER BANK HOLDING COMPANY.         THE FEDERAL RESERVE MUST APPROVE CERTAIN ADDITIONAL CAPITAL     CONTRIBUTIONS TO AN EXISTING     NON-U.S. INVESTMENT     AND CERTAIN DIRECT AND INDIRECT ACQUISITIONS BY THE COMPANY OF     AN INTEREST IN A     NON-U.S. COMPANY,     INCLUDING IN A FOREIGN BANK, AS WELL AS THE ESTABLISHMENT BY     CENTURION BANK OF FOREIGN BRANCHES IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.     ADDITIONALLY, A PROVISION OF DODD-FRANK THAT BECAME EFFECTIVE ON     THE DAY OF ENACTMENT REQUIRES BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH TOTAL     CONSOLIDATED ASSETS EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN $50 BILLION TO     PROVIDE THE FEDERAL RESERVE WITH WRITTEN NOTICE PRIOR TO     ACQUIRING DIRECT OR INDIRECT OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL OF ANY VOTING     SHARES OF ANY COMPANY (OTHER THAN AN INSURED DEPOSITORY     INSTITUTION) THAT IS ENGAGED IN FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES DESCRIBED     IN SECTION 4(K) OF THE BHC ACT AND THAT HAS TOTAL     CONSOLIDATED ASSETS OF $10 BILLION OR MORE, SUBJECT TO     CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS. MOREOVER, ANOTHER PROVISION OF DODD-FRANK     THAT IS EFFECTIVE ON THE TRANSFER DATE OF JULY 21, 2011,     BUT SUBJECT TO A POSSIBLE SIX-MONTH EXTENSION, REQUIRES     FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES TO OBTAIN FEDERAL RESERVE APPROVAL     PRIOR TO ACQUIRING A NONBANK COMPANY WITH TOTAL CONSOLIDATED     ASSETS IN EXCESS OF $10 BILLION.         THE CHANGE IN BANK CONTROL ACT PROHIBITS A PERSON, ENTITY, OR     GROUP OF PERSONS OR ENTITIES ACTING IN CONCERT, FROM ACQUIRING     \\x93CONTROL\\x94 OF A BANK HOLDING COMPANY SUCH AS THE     COMPANY UNLESS THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS BEEN GIVEN PRIOR NOTICE     AND HAS NOT OBJECTED TO THE TRANSACTION. UNDER FEDERAL RESERVE     REGULATIONS, THE ACQUISITION OF 10% OR MORE OF A CLASS OF VOTING     STOCK OF THE COMPANY WOULD GENERALLY CREATE A REBUTTABLE     PRESUMPTION OF ACQUISITION OF CONTROL OF THE COMPANY.         IN ADDITION, UNDER THE BHC ACT, ANY COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO     OBTAIN THE APPROVAL OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BEFORE ACQUIRING     CONTROL OF THE COMPANY, WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, INCLUDES THE     ACQUISITION OF OWNERSHIP OF OR CONTROL OVER 25% OR MORE OF ANY     CLASS OF VOTING SECURITIES OF THE COMPANY OR THE POWER TO     EXERCISE A \\x93CONTROLLING INFLUENCE\\x94 OVER THE COMPANY.     IN THE CASE OF AN ACQUIRER THAT IS A BANK OR BANK HOLDING     COMPANY, THE BHC ACT REQUIRES APPROVAL OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE     FOR THE ACQUISITION OF OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL OF ANY VOTING     SECURITIES OF THE COMPANY, IF THE ACQUISITION RESULTS IN THE     BANK OR BANK HOLDING COMPANY CONTROLLING MORE THAN 5% OF THE     OUTSTANDING SHARES OF ANY CLASS OF VOTING SECURITIES OF THE     COMPANY.     SOURCE OF     STRENGTH         FEDERAL RESERVE POLICY HISTORICALLY HAS REQUIRED BANK HOLDING     COMPANIES TO ACT AS A SOURCE OF STRENGTH TO THEIR BANK     SUBSIDIARIES AND TO COMMIT CAPITAL AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO     SUPPORT THOSE SUBSIDIARIES. DODD-FRANK MAKES THIS A STATUTORY     REQUIREMENT AND EXTENDS IT TO ALL INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION     SUBSIDIARIES BEGINNING ON JULY 21, 2011, SUBJECT TO A     POSSIBLE SIX-MONTH EXTENSION. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY IS EXPECTED     TO ACT AS A SOURCE OF STRENGTH TO CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB AND     TO COMMIT CAPITAL AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO SUPPORT BOTH     INSTITUTIONS. SUCH SUPPORT MAY BE REQUIRED AT TIMES WHEN, ABSENT     THIS REQUIREMENT, WE OTHERWISE MIGHT DETERMINE NOT TO     PROVIDE IT.         CAPITAL LOANS BY A BANK HOLDING COMPANY TO ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARY     BANKS ARE SUBORDINATE IN RIGHT OF PAYMENT TO DEPOSITS AND TO     CERTAIN OTHER INDEBTEDNESS OF SUCH SUBSIDIARY BANKS. IN THE     EVENT OF A BANK HOLDING COMPANY\\x92S BANKRUPTCY, ANY     COMMITMENT BY THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY TO A FEDERAL BANK     REGULATOR TO MAINTAIN THE CAPITAL OF A SUBSIDIARY BANK WILL BE     ASSUMED BY THE BANKRUPTCY TRUSTEE AND ENTITLED TO A PRIORITY OF     PAYMENT.     CAPITAL     ADEQUACY         THE COMPANY, TRS, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB ARE REQUIRED TO     COMPLY WITH THE APPLICABLE CAPITAL ADEQUACY GUIDELINES     ESTABLISHED BY THE FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS. THERE ARE TWO     RISK-BASED MEASURES OF          41    TABLE OF CONTENTS        CAPITAL ADEQUACY FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT HAVE BEEN     PROMULGATED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, AS WELL AS A LEVERAGE     MEASURE.         THE COMPANY CURRENTLY CALCULATES ITS RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIOS     UNDER GUIDELINES ADOPTED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, BASED ON THE     1998 CAPITAL ACCORD (\\x93BASEL I\\x94) OF THE BASEL COMMITTEE     ON BANKING SUPERVISION (THE \\x93BASEL COMMITTEE\\x94). IN     JUNE 2004, THE BASEL COMMITTEE PUBLISHED NEW INTERNATIONAL     GUIDELINES FOR DETERMINING REGULATORY CAPITAL (\\x93BASEL     II\\x94). IN DECEMBER 2007, THE U.S. BANK REGULATORY     AGENCIES JOINTLY ADOPTED A FINAL RULE BASED ON BASEL II. THE     COMPANY, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB ARE REQUIRED TO TRANSITION TO     THE BASEL II BASED GUIDELINES NO LATER THAN JANUARY 1,     2013, UNLESS EXTENDED BY ITS REGULATORS. IN DECEMBER 2010, THE     BASEL COMMITTEE RELEASED ITS FINAL FRAMEWORK FOR STRENGTHENING     INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY REGULATION, NOW OFFICIALLY     IDENTIFIED BY THE BASEL COMMITTEE AS \\x93BASEL III\\x94.     BASEL III, WHEN IMPLEMENTED BY THE U.S. BANKING AGENCIES     AND FULLY PHASED-IN, WILL REQUIRE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND     THEIR BANK SUBSIDIARIES TO MAINTAIN SUBSTANTIALLY MORE CAPITAL,     WITH A GREATER EMPHASIS ON COMMON EQUITY. EACH BASEL ACCORD IS     DISCUSSED BELOW.         THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL GUIDELINES ARE DESIGNED TO MAKE     REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS SENSITIVE TO DIFFERENCES IN     CREDIT AND MARKET RISK PROFILES AMONG BANKS AND FINANCIAL     HOLDING COMPANIES, TO ACCOUNT FOR OFF-BALANCE-SHEET EXPOSURE,     AND TO MINIMIZE DISINCENTIVES FOR HOLDING LIQUID ASSETS. ASSETS     AND OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ITEMS ARE ASSIGNED TO BROAD RISK     CATEGORIES, EACH WITH APPROPRIATE WEIGHTS. THE RESULTING CAPITAL     RATIOS REPRESENT CAPITAL AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL RISK-WEIGHTED     ASSETS AND OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ITEMS. AS A SUPERVISORY MATTER,     FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES EXPECT MOST BANK HOLDING     COMPANIES, AND IN PARTICULAR LARGER BANK HOLDING COMPANIES SUCH     AS THE COMPANY, TO MAINTAIN REGULATORY CAPITAL RATIOS THAT, AT A     MINIMUM, QUALIFY A BANK HOLDING COMPANY AND ITS DEPOSITORY     INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES AS \\x93WELL CAPITALIZED.\\x94 THE     REQUIRED RATIOS TO QUALIFY AS WELL CAPITALIZED ARE A TOTAL     RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO OF AT LEAST 10%, A TIER 1     RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO OF AT LEAST 6% AND A LEVERAGE RATIO OF     AT LEAST 5%. THE GUIDELINES ALSO PROVIDE THAT BANK HOLDING     COMPANIES EXPERIENCING INTERNAL GROWTH OR MAKING ACQUISITIONS     WILL BE EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN STRONG CAPITAL POSITIONS     SUBSTANTIALLY ABOVE THE MINIMUM SUPERVISORY LEVELS WITHOUT     SIGNIFICANT RELIANCE ON INTANGIBLE ASSETS. FOLLOWING THE RECENT     FINANCIAL CRISIS, THE FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES HAVE     ENCOURAGED LARGER BANK HOLDING COMPANIES TO MAINTAIN CAPITAL     RATIOS APPRECIABLY ABOVE THE \\x93WELL CAPITALIZED\\x94     STANDARD. MOREOVER, THE FEDERAL RESERVE IS FOCUSING MORE ON THE     REGULATORY REQUIREMENT THAT COMMON EQUITY BE THE     \\x93PREDOMINANT\\x94 ELEMENT OF TIER 1 CAPITAL.     FURTHERMORE, THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS INDICATED THAT IT WILL     CONSIDER A \\x93TANGIBLE TIER 1 CAPITAL LEVERAGE     RATIO\\x94 (DEDUCTING ALL INTANGIBLES) AND OTHER INDICATORS OF     CAPITAL STRENGTH IN EVALUATING PROPOSALS FOR EXPANSION OR NEW     ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION, THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS ASSESSED THE     CAPITAL ADEQUACY OF THE COUNTRY\\x92S 19 LARGEST BANK HOLDING     COMPANIES, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, UNDER A SO-CALLED \\x93STRESS     TEST\\x94.         FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR CAPITAL RATIOS, PLEASE     SEE \\x93CONSOLIDATED CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY\\x94 ON     PAGES 39-41 OF OUR 2010 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS,     WHICH INFORMATION IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.     BASEL     I         THE COMPANY, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB CURRENTLY CALCULATE     REGULATORY CAPITAL RATIOS UNDER BASEL I, AS ADOPTED BY THE     APPLICABLE FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES. UNDER BASEL I,     AS ADOPTED, THE MINIMUM GUIDELINE FOR THE RATIO OF TOTAL CAPITAL     TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS (INCLUDING CERTAIN OFF-BALANCE-SHEET     ITEMS, SUCH AS STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT) IS 8%. AT LEAST HALF     OF THE TOTAL CAPITAL MUST BE COMPOSED OF TIER 1 CAPITAL,     WHICH INCLUDES COMMON EQUITY, UNDIVIDED PROFITS, MINORITY     INTERESTS IN THE EQUITY ACCOUNTS OF CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES     (INCLUDING, FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES BUT NOT BANKS, TRUST     PREFERRED SECURITIES), NON-CUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK     AND FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES (BUT NOT BANKS) A LIMITED AMOUNT     OF CUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK, LESS GOODWILL AND     CERTAIN OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. TIER 2 CAPITAL MAY CONSIST     OF, AMONG OTHER THINGS, QUALIFYING SUBORDINATED DEBT,     MANDATORILY CONVERTIBLE DEBT SECURITIES, OTHER PREFERRED STOCK     AND TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES AND A LIMITED AMOUNT OF THE     ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES. NON-CUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED     STOCK, TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES AND OTHER SO-CALLED     \\x93RESTRICTED CORE CAPITAL ELEMENTS\\x94 ARE GENERALLY     LIMITED TO 25% OF TIER 1 CAPITAL. THE MINIMUM GUIDELINE FOR     THE RATIO OF TIER 1 CAPITAL TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS IS 4%.         42    TABLE OF CONTENTS        THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL RULES STATE THAT THE CAPITAL GUIDELINES     ARE MINIMUM STANDARDS BASED PRIMARILY ON BROAD CREDIT-RISK     CONSIDERATIONS AND DO NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE OTHER TYPES OF     RISK A BANKING ORGANIZATION MAY BE EXPOSED TO (E.G., INTEREST     RATE, MARKET, LIQUIDITY AND OPERATIONAL RISKS). THE FEDERAL     RESERVE MAY, THEREFORE, SET HIGHER CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR     CATEGORIES OF BANKS (E.G., SYSTEMATICALLY IMPORTANT FIRMS), OR     FOR AN INDIVIDUAL BANK, AS SITUATIONS WARRANT.     BASEL     II         THE U.S. BASEL II FINAL RULE BECAME EFFECTIVE ON     APRIL 1, 2008. THE COMPANY, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB ARE     REQUIRED TO TRANSITION TO THE BASEL II-BASED GUIDELINES BY     JANUARY 1, 2013,UNLESS EXTENDED BY ITS REGULATORS. THE     FINAL RULE PROVIDES FOR A SERIES OF THREE TRANSITIONAL PERIODS     DURING WHICH THE COMPANY MUST CALCULATE ITS RISK-BASED CAPITAL     RATIOS UNDER BOTH THE BASEL I-BASED GUIDELINES AND THE NEW BASEL     II-BASED GUIDELINES, WITH THE MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS     DURING THE TRANSITIONAL PERIODS BEING THE GREATER OF THE     REQUIRED CAPITAL AS CALCULATED UNDER THE FINAL RULE AND A     DESIGNATED PERCENTAGE OF REQUIRED CAPITAL AS CALCULATED UNDER     BASEL I. PRIOR TO BEGINNING THE THREE TRANSITIONAL PERIODS, WE     MUST COMPLETE A SATISFACTORY PARALLEL-RUN PERIOD OF NO LESS THAN     FOUR CONSECUTIVE CALENDAR QUARTERS DURING WHICH WE WILL BE     REQUIRED TO CONFIDENTIALLY REPORT REGULATORY CAPITAL UNDER BOTH     THE BASEL I AND BASEL II REGULATIONS. UNDER THE FINAL RULE,     WE MUST BEGIN THE FIRST TRANSITIONAL PERIOD FOR CAPITAL     CALCULATION UNDER THE FINAL RULE NO LATER THAN JANUARY 1,     2013, UNLESS THIS TIME IS EXTENDED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE.         DODD-FRANK APPEARS TO REQUIRE THE FEDERAL RESERVE TO ADOPT     REGULATIONS IMPOSING A CONTINUING \\x93FLOOR\\x94 OF THE BASEL     I-BASED CAPITAL GUIDELINES IN CASES WHERE THE BASEL II-BASED     CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND ANY CHANGES IN CAPITAL REGULATIONS     RESULTING FROM BASEL III OTHERWISE WOULD PERMIT LOWER     REQUIREMENTS. IN DECEMBER 2010, THE FEDERAL RESERVE PUBLISHED     FOR COMMENT PROPOSED REGULATIONS IMPLEMENTING THIS REQUIREMENT.     LEVERAGE     REQUIREMENT         BASEL I AND BASEL II DO NOT INCLUDE A LEVERAGE REQUIREMENT     AS AN INTERNATIONAL STANDARD. HOWEVER, THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS     ESTABLISHED MINIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO GUIDELINES FOR BANK HOLDING     COMPANIES (AND, AS FURTHER DISCUSSED BELOW, BASEL III WILL     IMPOSE A LEVERAGE REQUIREMENT AS AN INTERNATIONAL STANDARD). THE     FEDERAL RESERVE\\x92S EXISTING GUIDELINES PROVIDE FOR A MINIMUM     RATIO OF TIER 1 CAPITAL TO AVERAGE TOTAL ASSETS, LESS     GOODWILL AND CERTAIN OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS (THE \\x93LEVERAGE     RATIO\\x94), OF 3% FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT MEET CERTAIN     SPECIFIED CRITERIA, INCLUDING HAVING THE HIGHEST REGULATORY     RATING. ALL OTHER BANK HOLDING COMPANIES GENERALLY ARE REQUIRED     TO MAINTAIN A LEVERAGE RATIO OF AT LEAST 4%.     BASEL     III         THE BASEL III FINAL CAPITAL FRAMEWORK, AMONG OTHER THINGS:                 \\x95        INTRODUCES AS A NEW CAPITAL MEASURE \\x93COMMON EQUITY     TIER 1\\x94, OR \\x93CET1\\x94, SPECIFIES THAT     TIER 1 CAPITAL CONSISTS OF CET1 AND \\x93ADDITIONAL     TIER 1 CAPITAL\\x94 INSTRUMENTS MEETING SPECIFIED     REQUIREMENTS, DEFINES CET1 NARROWLY BY REQUIRING THAT MOST     ADJUSTMENTS TO REGULATORY CAPITAL MEASURES BE MADE TO CET1 AND     NOT TO THE OTHER COMPONENTS OF CAPITAL, AND EXPANDS THE SCOPE OF     THE ADJUSTMENTS AS COMPARED TO EXISTING REGULATIONS;            \\x95        WHEN FULLY PHASED IN ON JAN. 1, 2019, REQUIRES BANKS TO     MAINTAIN:                   \\x96        AS A NEWLY ADOPTED INTERNATIONAL STANDARD, A MINIMUM RATIO OF     CET1 TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS OF AT LEAST 4.5%, PLUS A 2.5%     \\x93CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER\\x94, WHICH IS ADDED TO THE     4.5% CET1 RATIO AS THAT BUFFER IS PHASED IN, EFFECTIVELY     RESULTING IN A MINIMUM RATIO OF CET1 TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS OF     AT LEAST 7% (THERE IS NO COMPARABLE CET1 REQUIREMENT UNDER BASEL     I OR II)            \\x96        A MINIMUM RATIO OF TIER 1 CAPITAL TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS     OF AT LEAST 6.0%, PLUS THE CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER, WHICH IS     ADDED TO THE 6.0% TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO AS THAT BUFFER IS     PHASED IN, EFFECTIVELY RESULTING IN A MINIMUM TIER 1     CAPITAL RATIO OF 8.5% UPON FULL IMPLEMENTATION (THE CURRENT     REQUIREMENT IS 6.00% FOR A WELL CAPITALIZED BANK)           43    TABLE OF CONTENTS                  \\x96        A MINIMUM RATIO OF TOTAL (THAT IS, TIER 1 PLUS     TIER 2) CAPITAL TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS OF AT LEAST     8.0%, PLUS THE CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER, WHICH IS ADDED TO     THE 8.0% TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO AS THAT BUFFER IS PHASED IN,     EFFECTIVELY RESULTING IN A MINIMUM TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO OF 10.5%     UPON FULL IMPLEMENTATION (THE CURRENT REQUIREMENT IS 10% FOR A     WELL CAPITALIZED BANK) AND            \\x96        AS A NEWLY ADOPTED INTERNATIONAL STANDARD, A MINIMUM LEVERAGE     RATIO OF 3%, CALCULATED AS THE RATIO OF TIER 1 CAPITAL TO     BALANCE SHEET EXPOSURES PLUS CERTAIN OFF-BALANCE SHEET EXPOSURES     (AS THE AVERAGE FOR EACH QUARTER OF THE MONTH-END RATIOS FOR THE     QUARTER) AND                   \\x95        PROVIDES FOR A \\x93COUNTERCYCLICAL CAPITAL BUFFER\\x94,     GENERALLY TO BE IMPOSED WHEN NATIONAL REGULATORS DETERMINE THAT     EXCESS AGGREGATE CREDIT GROWTH BECOMES ASSOCIATED WITH A BUILDUP     OF SYSTEMIC RISK, THAT WOULD BE A CET1 ADD-ON TO THE CAPITAL     CONSERVATION BUFFER IN THE RANGE OF 0% TO 2.5% WHEN FULLY     IMPLEMENTED (POTENTIALLY RESULTING IN TOTAL BUFFERS OF BETWEEN     2.5% AND 5%).           THE CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER IS DESIGNED TO ABSORB LOSSES     DURING PERIODS OF ECONOMIC STRESS. BANKING INSTITUTIONS WITH A     RATIO OF CET1 TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS ABOVE THE MINIMUM BUT     BELOW THE CONSERVATION BUFFER (OR BELOW THE COMBINED CAPITAL     CONSERVATION BUFFER AND COUNTERCYCLICAL CAPITAL BUFFER, WHEN THE     LATTER IS APPLIED) WILL FACE CONSTRAINTS ON DIVIDENDS, EQUITY     REPURCHASES AND COMPENSATION BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF THE     SHORTFALL.         THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BASEL III FINAL FRAMEWORK WILL     COMMENCE JANUARY 1, 2013. ON THAT DATE, BANKING     INSTITUTIONS WILL BE REQUIRED TO MEET THE FOLLOWING MINIMUM     CAPITAL RATIOS:                 \\x95        3.5% CET1 TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS;            \\x95        4.5% TIER 1 CAPITAL TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS; AND            \\x95        8.0% TOTAL CAPITAL TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS.           THE BASEL III FINAL FRAMEWORK PROVIDES FOR A NUMBER OF NEW     DEDUCTIONS FROM AND ADJUSTMENTS TO CET1. THESE INCLUDE, FOR     EXAMPLE, THE REQUIREMENT THAT MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS,     DEFERRED TAX ASSETS DEPENDENT UPON FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME AND     SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN NON-CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL ENTITIES     BE DEDUCTED FROM CET1 TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY ONE SUCH CATEGORY     EXCEEDS 10% OF CET1 OR ALL SUCH CATEGORIES IN THE AGGREGATE     EXCEED 15% OF CET1. THE AMOUNT OF THESE ASSETS THAT IS NOT     DEDUCTED FROM CET1 WILL BE RISK WEIGHTED AT 250%.         IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DEDUCTIONS AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS TO CET1     WILL BEGIN ON JANUARY 1, 2014 AND WILL BE PHASED-IN OVER A     FIVE-YEAR PERIOD (20% PER YEAR). THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE     CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER WILL BEGIN ON JANUARY 1, 2016     AT 0.625% AND BE PHASED IN OVER A FOUR-YEAR PERIOD (INCREASING     BY THAT AMOUNT ON EACH SUBSEQUENT JANUARY 1, UNTIL IT     REACHES 2.5% ON JANUARY 1, 2019).         THE U.S. BANKING AGENCIES HAVE INDICATED INFORMALLY THAT     THEY EXPECT TO PROPOSE REGULATIONS IMPLEMENTING BASEL III     IN MID-2011 WITH FINAL ADOPTION OF IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS IN     MID-2012. NOTWITHSTANDING ITS RELEASE OF THE BASEL III     FRAMEWORK AS A FINAL FRAMEWORK, THE BASEL COMMITTEE IS     CONSIDERING FURTHER AMENDMENTS TO BASEL III, INCLUDING THE     IMPOSITION OF ADDITIONAL CAPITAL SURCHARGES ON GLOBALLY     SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THE COMPANY DOES     NOT BELIEVE IT WILL BE CONSIDERED A GLOBALLY SYSTEMICALLY     IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. DODD-FRANK REQUIRES THE FEDERAL     BANKING AGENCIES TO ADOPT REGULATIONS AFFECTING     U.S. BANKING INSTITUTIONS\\x92 CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS IN A     NUMBER OF RESPECTS AND MANDATES THAT THE FEDERAL RESERVE ADOPT     PRUDENTIAL REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT     FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (INCLUDING RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND     LEVERAGE REQUIREMENTS) THAT ARE MORE STRINGENT THAN THOSE     APPLICABLE TO OTHER FINANCIAL COMPANIES. THE COMPANY IS A BANK     HOLDING COMPANY WITH MORE THAN $50 BILLION IN TOTAL     CONSOLIDATED ASSETS, SO IT IS CONSIDERED A SYSTEMICALLY     IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTION UNDER DODD-FRANK. THE     IMPLICATIONS OF THIS DESIGNATION ON THE COMPANY\\x92S CAPITAL     REQUIREMENTS ARE UNCERTAIN AT THIS TIME. ACCORDINGLY, THE     REGULATIONS ULTIMATELY APPLICABLE TO US MAY BE SUBSTANTIALLY     DIFFERENT FROM THE BASEL III FINAL FRAMEWORK AS PUBLISHED     IN DECEMBER 2010.         44    TABLE OF CONTENTS    LIQUIDITY     RATIOS UNDER BASEL III         HISTORICALLY, REGULATION AND MONITORING OF BANK AND BANK HOLDING     COMPANY LIQUIDITY HAS BEEN ADDRESSED AS A SUPERVISORY MATTER,     BOTH IN THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONALLY, WITHOUT REQUIRED     FORMULAIC MEASURES. THE BASEL III FINAL FRAMEWORK REQUIRES     BANKS AND BANK HOLDING COMPANIES TO MEASURE THEIR LIQUIDITY     AGAINST SPECIFIC LIQUIDITY TESTS THAT, ALTHOUGH SIMILAR IN SOME     RESPECTS TO LIQUIDITY MEASURES HISTORICALLY APPLIED BY BANKS AND     REGULATORS FOR MANAGEMENT AND SUPERVISORY PURPOSES, GOING     FORWARD WILL BE REQUIRED BY REGULATION. ONE TEST, REFERRED TO AS     THE LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO (\\x93LCR\\x94), IS DESIGNED TO     ENSURE THAT THE BANKING ENTITY MAINTAINS AN ADEQUATE LEVEL OF     UNENCUMBERED HIGH-QUALITY LIQUID ASSETS EQUAL TO THE     ENTITY\\x92S EXPECTED NET CASH OUTFLOW FOR A     30-DAY TIME     HORIZON (OR, IF GREATER, 25% OF ITS EXPECTED TOTAL CASH OUTFLOW)     UNDER AN ACUTE LIQUIDITY STRESS SCENARIO. THE OTHER TEST,     REFERRED TO AS THE NET STABLE FUNDING RATIO (\\x93NSFR\\x94),     IS DESIGNED TO PROMOTE MORE MEDIUM-AND LONG-TERM FUNDING OF THE     ASSETS AND ACTIVITIES OF BANKING ENTITIES OVER A ONE-YEAR TIME     HORIZON. THESE REQUIREMENTS WILL INCENT BANKING ENTITIES TO     INCREASE THEIR HOLDINGS OF U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES AND     OTHER SOVEREIGN DEBT AS A COMPONENT OF ASSETS AND INCREASE THE     USE OF LONG-TERM DEBT AS A FUNDING SOURCE. THE LCR WOULD BE     IMPLEMENTED SUBJECT TO AN OBSERVATION PERIOD BEGINNING IN 2011,     BUT WOULD NOT BE INTRODUCED AS A REQUIREMENT UNTIL     JANUARY 1, 2015, AND THE NSFR WOULD NOT BE INTRODUCED AS A     REQUIREMENT UNTIL JANUARY 1, 2018. THESE NEW STANDARDS ARE     SUBJECT TO FURTHER RULEMAKING AND THEIR TERMS MAY CHANGE BEFORE     IMPLEMENTATION.     PROMPT     CORRECTIVE ACTION         THE FDIA REQUIRES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT FEDERAL BANKING     REGULATORS TAKE PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION IN RESPECT OF     FDIC-INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS (SUCH AS CENTURION BANK AND     AEBFSB) THAT DO NOT MEET MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. THE FDIA     SPECIFIES FIVE CAPITAL TIERS: \\x93WELL CAPITALIZED,\\x94     \\x93ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED,\\x94     \\x93UNDERCAPITALIZED,\\x94 \\x93SIGNIFICANTLY     UNDERCAPITALIZED,\\x94 AND \\x93CRITICALLY     UNDERCAPITALIZED.\\x94 A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION\\x92S CAPITAL     TIER DEPENDS UPON HOW ITS CAPITAL LEVELS COMPARE TO VARIOUS     RELEVANT CAPITAL MEASURES AND CERTAIN OTHER FACTORS, AS     ESTABLISHED BY REGULATION. A BANK MAY BE DEEMED TO BE IN A     CAPITALIZATION CATEGORY THAT IS LOWER THAN IS INDICATED BY ITS     ACTUAL CAPITAL POSITION IF IT RECEIVES AN UNSATISFACTORY     EXAMINATION RATING. ONCE AN INSTITUTION BECOMES     \\x93UNDERCAPITALIZED,\\x94 THE FDIA IMPOSES PROGRESSIVELY     MORE RESTRICTIVE CONSTRAINTS ON OPERATIONS, MANAGEMENT AND     CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS, DEPENDING ON THE CAPITAL CATEGORY IN     WHICH AN INSTITUTION IS CLASSIFIED. A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION     THAT IS NOT WELL CAPITALIZED IS ALSO SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON     THE ACCEPTANCE OF BROKERED DEPOSITS INCLUDING CERTIFICATE OF     DEPOSIT ACCOUNT REGISTRY SERVICE DEPOSITS. THE MAJORITY OF THE     COMPANY\\x92S OUTSTANDING U.S. RETAIL DEPOSITS HAVE BEEN     RAISED THROUGH THIRD-PARTY CHANNELS AND ARE CONSIDERED BROKERED     DEPOSITS FOR BANK REGULATORY PURPOSES. AS PART OF ITS FUNDING     STRATEGY, A MAJORITY OF THE DEPOSITS RAISED DURING 2010 WERE     SOURCED DIRECTLY BY THE COMPANY WITH CONSUMERS THROUGH PERSONAL     SAVINGS FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS. FOR A DESCRIPTION OF OUR DEPOSIT     PROGRAMS, PLEASE SEE \\x93DEPOSIT PROGRAMS\\x94 BEGINNING ON     PAGE 24 ABOVE AND \\x93DEPOSIT PROGRAMS\\x94 ON     PAGE 43 OF OUR 2010 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH     INFORMATION IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.         THE FDIA GENERALLY PROHIBITS AN FDIC-INSURED DEPOSITORY     INSTITUTION FROM MAKING ANY CAPITAL DISTRIBUTION (INCLUDING     PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS) OR PAYING ANY MANAGEMENT FEE TO ITS     HOLDING COMPANY IF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION WOULD THEREAFTER     BE UNDERCAPITALIZED. UNDERCAPITALIZED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS     ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON BORROWING FROM THE FEDERAL     RESERVE AND TO GROWTH LIMITATIONS, AND ARE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT A     CAPITAL RESTORATION PLAN. FOR A CAPITAL RESTORATION PLAN TO BE     ACCEPTABLE, ANY HOLDING COMPANY MUST GUARANTEE THE CAPITAL PLAN     UP TO AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE LESSER OF 5% OF THE DEPOSITORY     INSTITUTION\\x92S ASSETS AT THE TIME IT BECAME UNDERCAPITALIZED     AND THE AMOUNT OF THE CAPITAL DEFICIENCY AT THE TIME IT FAILS TO     COMPLY WITH THE PLAN. IN THE EVENT OF THE HOLDING COMPANY\\x92S     BANKRUPTCY, SUCH GUARANTEE WOULD TAKE PRIORITY OVER CLAIMS OF     ITS GENERAL UNSECURED CREDITORS. IF A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION     FAILS TO SUBMIT AN ACCEPTABLE PLAN, IT IS TREATED AS IF IT IS     SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERCAPITALIZED.         SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERCAPITALIZED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS MAY BE     SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF REQUIREMENTS AND RESTRICTIONS, INCLUDING     ORDERS TO SELL SUFFICIENT VOTING STOCK TO BECOME ADEQUATELY     CAPITALIZED, REQUIREMENTS TO REDUCE TOTAL ASSETS AND CESSATION     OF RECEIPT OF DEPOSITS FROM CORRESPONDENT BANKS. CRITICALLY     UNDERCAPITALIZED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO     APPOINTMENT OF A RECEIVER OR CONSERVATOR.         45    TABLE OF CONTENTS    DIVIDENDS         THE COMPANY AND TRS AS WELL AS CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB ARE     LIMITED BY BANKING STATUTES AND REGULATIONS IN THEIR ABILITY TO     PAY DIVIDENDS. IN GENERAL, FEDERAL AND APPLICABLE STATE BANKING     LAWS PROHIBIT, WITHOUT FIRST OBTAINING REGULATORY APPROVAL,     INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS CENTURION BANK AND     AEBFSB, FROM MAKING DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTIONS IF SUCH DISTRIBUTIONS     ARE NOT PAID OUT OF AVAILABLE RECENT EARNINGS OR WOULD CAUSE THE     INSTITUTION TO FAIL TO MEET CAPITAL ADEQUACY STANDARDS. IN     ADDITION TO SPECIFIC LIMITATIONS ON THE DIVIDENDS THAT     SUBSIDIARY BANKS CAN PAY TO THEIR HOLDING COMPANIES, FEDERAL     REGULATORS COULD PROHIBIT A DIVIDEND THAT WOULD CONSTITUTE AN     UNSAFE OR UNSOUND BANKING PRACTICE IN LIGHT OF THE FINANCIAL     CONDITION OF THE BANKING ORGANIZATION.         DIVIDEND PAYMENTS BY THE COMPANY AND TRS TO SHAREHOLDERS ARE     SUBJECT TO THE OVERSIGHT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE. IT IS FEDERAL     RESERVE POLICY THAT BANK HOLDING COMPANIES GENERALLY SHOULD PAY     DIVIDENDS ON COMMON STOCK TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS ONLY OUT OF NET     INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS OVER THE PAST YEAR AND     ONLY IF THE PROSPECTIVE RATE OF EARNINGS RETENTION APPEARS     CONSISTENT WITH THE ORGANIZATION\\x92S CURRENT AND EXPECTED     FUTURE CAPITAL NEEDS, ASSET QUALITY, AND OVERALL FINANCIAL     CONDITION. MOREOVER, BANK HOLDING COMPANIES SHOULD NOT MAINTAIN     DIVIDEND LEVELS THAT PLACE UNDUE PRESSURE ON THE CAPITAL OF     DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES OR THAT MAY UNDERMINE THE     BANK HOLDING COMPANY\\x92S ABILITY TO BE A SOURCE OF STRENGTH     TO ITS BANKING SUBSIDIARIES. THE FEDERAL RESERVE COULD PROHIBIT     A DIVIDEND BY THE COMPANY OR TRS THAT WOULD CONSTITUTE AN UNSAFE     OR UNSOUND BANKING PRACTICE IN LIGHT OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION     OF THE BANKING ORGANIZATION.         UNDER \\x93TEMPORARY\\x94 GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE FEDERAL     RESERVE IN NOVEMBER 2010, BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, SUCH AS THE     COMPANY AND TRS, SHOULD CONSULT WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE BEFORE     TAKING ANY ACTIONS THAT COULD RESULT IN A DIMINISHED CAPITAL     BASE, INCLUDING ACTIONS SUCH AS INCREASING DIVIDENDS. THE     FEDERAL RESERVE WILL ASSESS THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY\\x92S     CAPITAL ADEQUACY BASED ON CAPITAL PLANS AND STRESS TESTS     SUBMITTED BY THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY. THE FEDERAL RESERVE WILL     REVIEW THE CAPITAL PLANS, INCLUDING DIVIDEND POLICIES, AGAINST,     AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY\\x92S ABILITY TO     ACHIEVE BASEL III CAPITAL RATIO REQUIREMENTS REFERRED TO     ABOVE AS THEY ARE PHASED IN BY U.S. REGULATORS AND ANY     POTENTIAL IMPACT OF DODD-FRANK ON THE COMPANY\\x92S RISK     PROFILE, BUSINESS STRATEGY, CORPORATE STRUCTURE OR CAPITAL     ADEQUACY. A COMPANY THAT HAS NOT ACHIEVED BASEL III CAPITAL     REQUIREMENTS ON A FULLY PHASED-IN BASIS MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY     INCREASING DIVIDENDS. ALTHOUGH THE REGULATIONS ULTIMATELY     APPLICABLE TO THE COMPANY WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE FEDERAL     RESERVE, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT, HAD REGULATIONS     IMPLEMENTING BASEL III BEEN IN PLACE DURING THE FOURTH     QUARTER OF 2010, THE COMPANY\\x92S CAPITAL RATIOS UNDER     BASEL III WOULD HAVE EXCEEDED THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS.     THIS ESTIMATE COULD CHANGE IN THE FUTURE. ALTHOUGH WE EXPECT TO     MEET THE BASEL III CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, INCLUSIVE OF THE     CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER, AS PHASED IN BY THE FEDERAL     RESERVE, THE REGULATIONS ULTIMATELY APPLICABLE TO US MAY BE     SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE BASEL III FINAL FRAMEWORK     AS PUBLISHED IN DECEMBER 2010.     TRANSACTIONS     BETWEEN CENTURION BANK OR AEBFSB AND THEIR RESPECTIVE     AFFILIATES         CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS (INCLUDING LOANS AND CREDIT EXTENSIONS FROM     CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB) BETWEEN CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, ON     THE ONE HAND, AND THEIR AFFILIATES (INCLUDING THE COMPANY, TRS     AND THEIR NON-BANK SUBSIDIARIES), ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE SUBJECT     TO QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE LIMITATIONS, COLLATERAL     REQUIREMENTS, AND OTHER RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY STATUTE AND     FEDERAL RESERVE REGULATION. EFFECTIVE JULY 21, 2012     (SUBJECT TO A SIX-MONTH EXTENSION) DODD-FRANK SIGNIFICANTLY     EXPANDS THE COVERAGE AND SCOPE OF THE LIMITATIONS ON AFFILIATE     TRANSACTIONS WITHIN A BANKING ORGANIZATION AND CHANGES THE     PROCEDURE FOR SEEKING EXEMPTIONS FROM THESE RESTRICTIONS.     TRANSACTIONS SUBJECT TO THESE RESTRICTIONS ARE GENERALLY     REQUIRED TO BE MADE ON AN ARMS-LENGTH BASIS. THESE RESTRICTIONS     GENERALLY DO NOT APPLY TO TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN A DEPOSITORY     INSTITUTION AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES.     FDIC     INSURANCE ASSESSMENTS         CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB ACCEPT DEPOSITS, AND THOSE DEPOSITS     ARE INSURED BY THE FDIC UP TO THE APPLICABLE LIMITS. THE     FDIC\\x92S DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND (\\x93DEPOSIT INSURANCE     FUND\\x94) IS FUNDED BY ASSESSMENTS ON INSURED DEPOSITORY     INSTITUTIONS, WHICH CURRENTLY DEPEND ON THE RISK CATEGORY OF AN     INSTITUTION AND THE AMOUNT OF          46    TABLE OF CONTENTS        INSURED DEPOSITS THAT THE INSTITUTION HOLDS. THE FDIC MAY     INCREASE OR DECREASE THE ASSESSMENT RATE SCHEDULE ON A     SEMI-ANNUAL BASIS.         AS PART OF ITS EFFORTS TO REBUILD THE DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND,     THE FDIC REQUIRED INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING     CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, TO PREPAY THEIR ESTIMATED ASSESSMENTS     FOR ALL OF 2010, 2011 AND 2012 ON DECEMBER 30, 2009.         DODD-FRANK REQUIRES THE FDIC TO AMEND ITS REGULATIONS TO BASE     INSURANCE ASSESSMENTS ON THE AVERAGE CONSOLIDATED TOTAL ASSETS     LESS THE AVERAGE TANGIBLE EQUITY OF THE INSURED DEPOSITORY     INSTITUTION DURING THE ASSESSMENT PERIOD (THE \\x93NEW     ASSESSMENT BASE\\x94). THE FDIC HAS APPROVED A FINAL RULE,     EFFECTIVE APRIL 1, 2011, THAT IMPLEMENTS THE REQUIRED     CHANGE TO THE ASSESSMENT BASE AND CHANGES THE ASSESSMENT RATE     CALCULATION FOR LARGE INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING     CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB. EFFECTIVE APRIL 1, 2011, THE     ASSESSMENT RATES WILL BE SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENTS BASED UPON THE     INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION\\x92S RATIO OF     (1) LONG-TERM UNSECURED DEBT TO THE NEW ASSESSMENT BASE,     (2) LONG-TERM UNSECURED DEBT ISSUED BY ANOTHER INSURED     DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION TO THE NEW ASSESSMENT BASE, AND     (3) BROKERED DEPOSITS TO THE NEW ASSESSMENT BASE. HOWEVER,     EFFECTIVE APRIL 1, 2011, THE ADJUSTMENTS BASED ON BROKERED     DEPOSITS TO THE NEW ASSESSMENT BASE WILL NOT APPLY SO LONG AS     THE INSTITUTION IS WELL CAPITALIZED AND HAS A COMPOSITE CAMELS     RATING OF 1 OR 2. ADDITIONALLY, THE RULES PERMIT THE FDIC TO     IMPOSE ADDITIONAL DISCRETIONARY ASSESSMENT RATE ADJUSTMENTS.     THESE CHANGES COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF     OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. FURTHERMORE, FUTURE CHANGES     TO DEPOSIT INSURANCE ASSESSMENTS ALSO COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE     EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATION AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.         DODD-FRANK ALSO REQUIRES THE FDIC TO INCREASE THE RESERVE RATIO     FOR THE DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND FROM 1.15 PERCENT TO REACH A     MINIMUM OF 1.35 PERCENT OF ESTIMATED INSURED DEPOSITS BY     SEPTEMBER 30, 2020. ON DECEMBER 20, 2010, THE FDIC     ISSUED A FINAL RULE SETTING THE INCREASED RESERVE RATIO AT     2 PERCENT. THIS INCREASE WILL RESULT IN INCREASED COSTS FOR     CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB. IN ADDITION, DODD-FRANK ELIMINATES     THE CEILING (1.5 PERCENT OF INSURED DEPOSITS) ON THE SIZE     OF THE DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND AND MAKES THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS     FROM THE DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND BY THE FDIC DISCRETIONARY.         UNDER THE FDIA, THE FDIC MAY TERMINATE THE INSURANCE OF AN     INSTITUTION\\x92S DEPOSITS UPON A FINDING THAT THE INSTITUTION     HAS ENGAGED IN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND PRACTICES, IS IN AN UNSAFE OR     UNSOUND CONDITION TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS OR HAS VIOLATED ANY     APPLICABLE LAW, REGULATION, RULE, ORDER OR CONDITION IMPOSED BY     THE FDIC. WE DO NOT KNOW OF ANY PRACTICE, CONDITION OR VIOLATION     THAT MIGHT LEAD TO TERMINATION OF DEPOSIT INSURANCE AT EITHER OF     OUR INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES.     FDIC     POWERS UPON INSOLVENCY OF INSURED DEPOSITORY     INSTITUTIONS         IF THE FDIC IS APPOINTED THE CONSERVATOR OR RECEIVER OF AN     INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION, SUCH AS CENTURION BANK OR     AEBFSB, UPON ITS INSOLVENCY OR IN CERTAIN OTHER EVENTS, THE FDIC     HAS THE POWER: (1) TO TRANSFER ANY OF THE DEPOSITORY     INSTITUTION\\x92S ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO A NEW OBLIGOR     WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION\\x92S     CREDITORS; (2) TO ENFORCE THE TERMS OF THE DEPOSITORY     INSTITUTION\\x92S CONTRACTS PURSUANT TO THEIR TERMS; OR     (3) TO REPUDIATE OR DISAFFIRM ANY CONTRACT OR LEASE TO     WHICH THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IS A PARTY, THE PERFORMANCE OF     WHICH IS DETERMINED BY THE FDIC TO BE BURDENSOME AND THE     DISAFFIRMATION OR REPUDIATION OF WHICH IS DETERMINED BY THE FDIC     TO PROMOTE THE ORDERLY ADMINISTRATION OF THE DEPOSITORY     INSTITUTION.         IN ADDITION, UNDER FEDERAL LAW, THE CLAIMS OF HOLDERS OF     U.S. DEPOSIT LIABILITIES AND CERTAIN CLAIMS FOR     ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AGAINST AN INSURED DEPOSITORY     INSTITUTION WOULD BE AFFORDED A PRIORITY OVER OTHER GENERAL     UNSECURED CLAIMS AGAINST THE INSTITUTION, INCLUDING CLAIMS OF     DEBT HOLDERS OF THE INSTITUTION AND DEPOSITORS IN     NON-U.S. OFFICES,     IN THE LIQUIDATION OR OTHER RESOLUTION OF THE INSTITUTION BY A     RECEIVER. AS A RESULT, WHETHER OR NOT THE FDIC EVER SOUGHT TO     REPUDIATE ANY DEBT OBLIGATIONS OF CENTURION BANK OR AEBFSB, THE     DEBT HOLDERS WOULD BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY FROM, AND COULD     RECEIVE SUBSTANTIALLY LESS, IF ANYTHING, THAN THE DEPOSITORS IN     U.S. OFFICES OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION.         47    TABLE OF CONTENTS    ORDERLY     LIQUIDATION AUTHORITY UNDER DODD-FRANK         DODD-FRANK CREATES ORDERLY LIQUIDATION AUTHORITY     (\\x93OLA\\x94), A RESOLUTION REGIME FOR SYSTEMICALLY     IMPORTANT NON-BANK FINANCIAL COMPANIES, INCLUDING BANK HOLDING     COMPANIES, UNDER WHICH THE TREASURY SECRETARY MAY APPOINT THE     FDIC AS RECEIVER TO LIQUIDATE SUCH A COMPANY IF THE COMPANY IS     IN DANGER OF DEFAULT AND PRESENTS A SYSTEMIC RISK TO     U.S. FINANCIAL STABILITY. THIS DETERMINATION BY THE     TREASURY SECRETARY MUST COME AFTER SUPERMAJORITY RECOMMENDATIONS     BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND THE FDIC AND CONSULTATION BY THE     TREASURY SECRETARY WITH THE PRESIDENT. OLA IS SIMILAR TO THE     FDIC RESOLUTION MODEL FOR DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, WITH CERTAIN     MODIFICATIONS TO REFLECT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DEPOSITORY     INSTITUTIONS AND NON-BANK FINANCIAL COMPANIES AND TO REDUCE     DISPARITIES BETWEEN THE TREATMENT OF CREDITORS\\x92 CLAIMS     UNDER THE U.S. BANKRUPTCY CODE AND IN AN OLA PROCEEDING AS     COMPARED TO DISPARITIES THAT WOULD EXIST IN THE RESOLUTION BY     THE FDIC OF AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION.         AN ORDERLY LIQUIDATION FUND WILL FUND OLA LIQUIDATION     PROCEEDINGS THROUGH BORROWINGS FROM THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF     TREASURY AND RISK-BASED ASSESSMENTS MADE, FIRST, ON ENTITIES     THAT RECEIVE MORE IN THE RESOLUTION THAN THEY WOULD HAVE     RECEIVED IN LIQUIDATION TO THE EXTENT OF SUCH EXCESS, AND     SECOND, IF NECESSARY, ON BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH TOTAL     CONSOLIDATED ASSETS OF $50 BILLION OR MORE, SUCH AS THE     COMPANY, AND ON CERTAIN OTHER NON-BANK FINANCIAL COMPANIES. IF     AN ORDERLY LIQUIDATION IS TRIGGERED, THE COMPANY COULD FACE     ASSESSMENTS FOR THE ORDERLY LIQUIDATION FUND. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE     TO DETERMINE THE LEVEL OF ANY SUCH FUTURE ASSESSMENTS.     CROSS-GUARANTEE     PROVISIONS         UNDER THE \\x93CROSS-GUARANTEE\\x94 PROVISION OF THE FINANCIAL     INSTITUTIONS REFORM, RECOVERY AND ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 1989     (\\x93FIRREA\\x94), INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS     CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, MAY BE LIABLE TO THE FDIC WITH     RESPECT TO ANY LOSS INCURRED OR REASONABLY ANTICIPATED TO BE     INCURRED BY THE FDIC IN CONNECTION WITH THE DEFAULT OF, OR FDIC     ASSISTANCE TO, ANY COMMONLY CONTROLLED INSURED DEPOSITORY     INSTITUTION. CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB ARE COMMONLY CONTROLLED     WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE FIRREA CROSS-GUARANTEE PROVISION.     COMMUNITY     REINVESTMENT ACT         CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB ARE SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE     CRA. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE CRA, THE PRIMARY FEDERAL REGULATOR     OF A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IS REQUIRED, IN CONNECTION WITH ITS     EXAMINATION OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION, TO ASSESS SUCH     DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION\\x92S RECORD IN MEETING THE CREDIT NEEDS     OF THE COMMUNITIES SERVED BY THAT DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION,     INCLUDING LOW- AND MODERATE-INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS. FURTHERMORE,     SUCH ASSESSMENT ALSO IS REQUIRED OF ANY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION     THAT HAS APPLIED TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, MERGE OR CONSOLIDATE     WITH OR ACQUIRE THE ASSETS OR ASSUME THE LIABILITIES OF A     FEDERALLY REGULATED FINANCIAL INSTITUTION OR TO OPEN OR RELOCATE     A BRANCH OFFICE. IN THE CASE OF A BANK HOLDING COMPANY APPLYING     FOR APPROVAL TO ACQUIRE A BANK OR BANK HOLDING COMPANY, THE     FEDERAL RESERVE WILL ASSESS THE RECORD OF EACH SUBSIDIARY     DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION OF THE APPLICANT BANK HOLDING COMPANY IN     CONSIDERING THE APPLICATION. IN ADDITION, AS DISCUSSED     PREVIOUSLY, THE FAILURE OF THE COMPANY\\x92S SUBSIDIARY     DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS TO MAINTAIN SATISFACTORY CRA RATINGS     COULD RESULT IN RESTRICTIONS ON THE COMPANY\\x92S AND TRS\\x92     ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN ACTIVITIES IN RELIANCE ON FINANCIAL HOLDING     COMPANY AUTHORITY.     PRIVACY,     FAIR CREDIT REPORTING         WE USE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR CUSTOMERS TO DEVELOP AND MAKE     AVAILABLE RELEVANT, PERSONALIZED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.     CUSTOMERS ARE GIVEN CHOICES ABOUT HOW WE USE AND DISCLOSE THEIR     INFORMATION, AND WE GIVE THEM NOTICE REGARDING THE MEASURES WE     TAKE TO SAFEGUARD THIS INFORMATION. REGULATORY ACTIVITY IN THE     AREAS OF PRIVACY AND DATA SECURITY CONTINUES TO INCREASE     WORLDWIDE, SPURRED BY ADVANCEMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY AND RELATED     CONCERNS ABOUT THE RAPID AND WIDESPREAD DISSEMINATION AND USE OF     INFORMATION. OUR REGULATORY EXAMINERS, AS WELL AS OUR AUDITORS,     ARE INCREASINGLY FOCUSED ON ENSURING THAT OUR PRIVACY AND DATA     SECURITY/ACCESS CONTROL POLICIES AND PRACTICES ARE ADEQUATE TO     INFORM OUR CUSTOMERS OF OUR DATA USES AND TO PROTECT THEIR     PERSONAL DATA.         48    TABLE OF CONTENTS        AS NOTED ABOVE, AS PART OF OUR EFFORTS TO ENHANCE PAYMENT     ACCOUNT DATA SECURITY, IN 2006, WE AND SEVERAL OTHER PAYMENT     CARD NETWORKS FORMED THE PCI SSC, AN INDEPENDENT     STANDARDS-SETTING ORGANIZATION TO MANAGE THE EVOLUTION OF THE     PCI DATA SECURITY STANDARD, WHICH HELPS ORGANIZATIONS THAT     PROCESS CARD PAYMENTS TO PREVENT CREDIT/CHARGE CARD SECURITY     BREACHES AND FRAUD THROUGH INCREASED CONTROLS AROUND DATA AND     ITS EXPOSURE TO COMPROMISE.         THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT (\\x93GLBA\\x94) BECAME EFFECTIVE     ON JULY 1, 2001. THE GLBA REQUIRES CONSUMER NOTICE OF A     FINANCIAL INSTITUTION\\x92S PRIVACY POLICIES AND PRACTICES AND     AFFORDS CUSTOMERS THE RIGHT TO \\x93OPT OUT\\x94 OF THE     INSTITUTION\\x92S DISCLOSURE OF THEIR PERSONAL FINANCIAL     INFORMATION TO NONAFFILIATED THIRD PARTIES (WITH LIMITED     EXCEPTIONS). THIS LEGISLATION DOES NOT PREEMPT STATE LAWS THAT     AFFORD GREATER PRIVACY PROTECTIONS TO CONSUMERS, AND SEVERAL     STATES HAVE ADOPTED SUCH LEGISLATION. FOR EXAMPLE, IN 2003     CALIFORNIA ENACTED THAT STATE\\x92S FINANCIAL INFORMATION     PRIVACY ACT, WHICH REQUIRES (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS)     \\x93OPT-IN\\x94 CONSENT FROM CUSTOMERS BEFORE THEIR DATA MAY     BE DISCLOSED TO NONAFFILIATED THIRD PARTIES.         IN ADDITION, VARIOUS FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORY AGENCIES, AND AS     MANY AS 46 STATES, THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, PUERTO RICO     AND THE VIRGIN ISLANDS, HAVE ENACTED SECURITY BREACH LAWS AND     REGULATIONS, REQUIRING VARYING LEVELS OF CONSUMER NOTIFICATION     IN THE EVENT OF A DATA SECURITY BREACH. DATA BREACH LAWS ARE     ALSO BECOMING MORE PREVALENT IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD WHERE     WE OPERATE, INCLUDING JAPAN, MEXICO AND GERMANY. IN MANY     COUNTRIES THAT HAVE YET TO IMPOSE AUTOMATIC DATA BREACH     NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS, REGULATORS HAVE INCREASINGLY USED THE     THREAT OF SIGNIFICANT SANCTIONS AND PENALTIES BY DATA PROTECTION     AUTHORITIES TO ENCOURAGE VOLUNTARY NOTIFICATION AND DISCOURAGE     DATA BREACHES.         BEYOND THESE DATA BREACH LAWS, WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE GLBA\\x92S     REQUIREMENTS TO SAFEGUARD CUSTOMER INFORMATION, AND TO A GROWING     NUMBER OF STATE LAWS (INCLUDING IN MASSACHUSETTS AND NEVADA)     THAT IMPOSE BROAD-RANGING DATA SECURITY OBLIGATIONS REGARDING     THE PROTECTION OF CUSTOMER AND EMPLOYEE DATA. IN 1995, THE     EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND COUNCIL PASSED EUROPEAN DIRECTIVE     95/46/EC ON THE PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUALS WITH REGARD TO THE     PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA AND ON THE FREE MOVEMENT OF SUCH     DATA (COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE DATA PROTECTION DIRECTIVE),     WHICH OBLIGATES THE CONTROLLER OF AN INDIVIDUAL\\x92S PERSONAL     DATA TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TAKE THE NECESSARY TECHNICAL AND     ORGANIZATIONAL STEPS TO PROTECT PERSONAL DATA. COMPLIANCE WITH     THESE VARIOUS LAWS COULD RESULT IN HIGHER TECHNOLOGY,     ADMINISTRATIVE AND OTHER COSTS FOR THE COMPANY. IN JULY 2010, WE     SUBMITTED FOR REVIEW BY RELEVANT EUROPEAN DATA PROTECTION     AUTHORITIES OUR DRAFT BINDING CORPORATE RULES FOR PROCESSING OF     DATA WITHIN THE AMERICAN EXPRESS GROUP WHICH, ONCE APPROVED,     WILL ENABLE A MORE EFFICIENT BASIS ON WHICH TO TRANSFER DATA     WITHIN OUR GROUP. THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION IS CURRENTLY ASSESSING     THE NEED FOR FURTHER CHANGES TO THE EUROPEAN UNION\\x92S DATA     PROTECTION REGIME.         WE CONTINUE OUR EFFORTS TO SAFEGUARD THE DATA ENTRUSTED TO US IN     ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW AND OUR INTERNAL DATA PROTECTION     POLICIES, INCLUDING TAKING STEPS TO REDUCE THE POTENTIAL FOR     IDENTITY THEFT OR OTHER FRAUD, WHILE SEEKING TO COLLECT AND USE     DATA PROPERLY TO ACHIEVE OUR BUSINESS OBJECTIVES. WE ALSO HAVE     UNDERTAKEN MEASURES TO ASSESS THE LEVEL OF ACCESS TO CUSTOMER     DATA BY OUR EMPLOYEES AND OUR PARTNERS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS,     AND TO ENSURE THAT SUCH ACCESS IS LIMITED TO THE LEAST     PRIVILEGED LEVEL NECESSARY TO PERFORM THEIR JOB OR FUNCTION FOR     THE COMPANY.         THE FCRA REGULATES THE DISCLOSURE OF CONSUMER CREDIT REPORTS BY     CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCIES AND THE USE OF CONSUMER CREDIT     REPORT INFORMATION BY BANKS AND OTHER COMPANIES. AMONG OTHER     THINGS, FCRA PLACES RESTRICTIONS (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS) ON     THE SHARING AND USE OF CERTAIN PERSONAL FINANCIAL AND     CREDITWORTHINESS INFORMATION OF OUR CUSTOMERS WITH AND BY OUR     AFFILIATES.         FCRA WAS SIGNIFICANTLY AMENDED BY THE ENACTMENT IN DECEMBER 2003     OF THE FACT ACT. THE FACT ACT REQUIRES ANY COMPANY THAT RECEIVES     INFORMATION CONCERNING A CONSUMER FROM AN AFFILIATE, SUBJECT TO     CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, TO PERMIT THE CONSUMER TO OPT OUT FROM     HAVING THAT INFORMATION USED TO MARKET THE COMPANY\\x92S     PRODUCTS TO THE CONSUMER. IN NOVEMBER 2007, THE FEDERAL BANKING     AGENCIES ISSUED A FINAL RULE IMPLEMENTING THE AFFILIATE     MARKETING PROVISIONS OF THE FACT ACT. COMPANIES SUBJECT TO     OVERSIGHT BY THESE AGENCIES WERE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THE     RULES BY OCTOBER 1, 2008. THE COMPANY HAS IMPLEMENTED     VARIOUS MECHANISMS TO ALLOW OUR CUSTOMERS TO OPT OUT OF     AFFILIATE SHARING AND OF MARKETING BY THE COMPANY AND OUR     AFFILIATES, AND IT CONTINUES TO REVIEW AND ENHANCE THESE     MECHANISMS TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW AND A     FAVORABLE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE.         49    TABLE OF CONTENTS        THE FACT ACT FURTHER AMENDED THE FCRA BY ADDING SEVERAL NEW     PROVISIONS DESIGNED TO PREVENT OR DECREASE IDENTITY THEFT AND TO     IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF CONSUMER CREDIT INFORMATION. THE FEDERAL     BANKING AGENCIES AND THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION     (\\x93FTC\\x94) PUBLISHED A FINAL RULE IN NOVEMBER 2007     REQUIRING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO IMPLEMENT A PROGRAM     CONTAINING REASONABLE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO ADDRESS THE     RISK OF IDENTITY THEFT AND TO IDENTIFY ACCOUNTS WHERE IDENTITY     THEFT IS MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR. COMPANIES SUBJECT TO OVERSIGHT BY     THE FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES ORIGINALLY WERE REQUIRED TO COMPLY     WITH THE RULE BY NOVEMBER 1, 2008, BUT THE FTC SUSPENDED     ENFORCEMENT OF ITS RULE THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2010 PENDING     LEGISLATION TO CLARIFY THE LAW\\x92S SCOPE. ON     DECEMBER 18, 2010, THE PRESIDENT SIGNED THE RED FLAG     PROGRAM CLARIFICATION ACT OF 2010 INTO LAW. THE COMPANY\\x92S     INTERNAL POLICIES AND STANDARDS, AS WELL AS OUR ENTERPRISE-WIDE     DATA SECURITY AND FRAUD PREVENTION PROGRAMS, COMPLY WITH THE NEW     IDENTITY THEFT REQUIREMENTS.         THE FACT ACT ALSO IMPOSES DUTIES ON BOTH CONSUMER REPORTING     AGENCIES AND ON BUSINESSES THAT FURNISH OR USE INFORMATION     CONTAINED IN CONSUMER CREDIT REPORTS. FOR EXAMPLE, A FURNISHER     OF INFORMATION IS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT PROCEDURES TO PREVENT     THE REPORTING OF ANY INFORMATION THAT IT LEARNS IS THE RESULT OF     IDENTITY THEFT. ALSO, IF A CONSUMER DISPUTES THE ACCURACY OF     INFORMATION PROVIDED TO A CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCY, THE     FURNISHER OF THAT INFORMATION MUST CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION AND     RESPOND TO THE CONSUMER IN A TIMELY FASHION. THE FEDERAL BANKING     REGULATORY AGENCIES AND THE FTC HAVE ISSUED RULES THAT SPECIFY     THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH FURNISHERS OF INFORMATION WOULD BE     REQUIRED TO INVESTIGATE DISPUTES REGARDING THE ACCURACY OF THE     INFORMATION PROVIDED TO A CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCY. THE FACT     ACT ALSO REQUIRES GRANTORS OF CREDIT THAT USE CONSUMER CREDIT     REPORT INFORMATION IN MAKING A DETERMINATION TO OFFER A BORROWER     CREDIT ON TERMS THAT ARE \\x93MATERIALLY LESS FAVORABLE\\x94     THAN THE TERMS OFFERED TO MOST OF THE LENDER\\x92S OTHER     CUSTOMERS TO NOTIFY THE BORROWER THAT THE TERMS ARE BASED ON A     CONSUMER CREDIT REPORT. IN SUCH A CASE THE BORROWER IS ENTITLED     TO RECEIVE A FREE COPY OF THE REPORT FROM THE CONSUMER REPORTING     AGENCY. THE FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES AND THE FTC HAVE     ISSUED RULES THAT SPECIFY THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH     \\x93RISK-BASED PRICING\\x94 NOTICES MUST BE PROVIDED TO     CUSTOMERS AND THE CONTENT, FORMAT AND TIMING OF SUCH NOTICES.     DODD-FRANK WILL REQUIRE, EFFECTIVE JULY 21, 2011, THE     ADDITION OF CERTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT CREDIT SCORES TO     \\x93RISK-BASED PRICING\\x94 NOTICES AND TO ADVERSE ACTION     NOTICES OTHERWISE REQUIRED BY THE FCRA. GRANTORS OF CREDIT USING     PRESCREENED CONSUMER CREDIT REPORT INFORMATION IN CREDIT     SOLICITATIONS ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO INCLUDE AN ENHANCED NOTICE TO     CONSUMERS THAT THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT FROM RECEIVING     FURTHER PRESCREENED OFFERS OF CREDIT. THE ENACTMENT OF THE FACT     ACT AND THE PROMULGATION OF RULES IMPLEMENTING IT ARE NOT     EXPECTED TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS OR     PRACTICES.     THE CARD     ACT         IN MAY 2009, THE CARD ACT WAS ENACTED TO PROHIBIT CERTAIN     PRACTICES FOR CONSUMER CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTS. THE CARD ACT, AMONG     OTHER REQUIREMENTS, PROHIBITS ISSUERS FROM TREATING A PAYMENT AS     LATE FOR ANY PURPOSE, INCLUDING INCREASING THE APR OR IMPOSING A     FEE, UNLESS A CONSUMER HAS BEEN PROVIDED A \\x93REASONABLE     AMOUNT OF TIME\\x94 TO MAKE THE PAYMENT. IT ALSO REQUIRES     ISSUERS TO APPLY PAYMENT AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF THE MINIMUM     PAYMENT FIRST TO THE BALANCE WITH THE HIGHEST APR AND THEN TO     BALANCES WITH LOWER APRS. IN ADDITION, THE ACT PROHIBITS AN     ISSUER FROM INCREASING THE APR ON OUTSTANDING BALANCES, EXCEPT     IN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS WHEN A PROMOTIONAL RATE     EXPIRES, A VARIABLE RATE ADJUSTS, OR AN ACCOUNT IS SERIOUSLY     DELINQUENT OR COMPLETES A WORKOUT ARRANGEMENT. THESE     REQUIREMENTS BECAME EFFECTIVE ON FEBRUARY 22, 2010.         THE CARD ACT ALSO REQUIRES ISSUERS TO MAINTAIN REASONABLE     WRITTEN POLICIES TO CONSIDER A CONSUMER\\x92S INCOME OR ASSETS     AND CURRENT OBLIGATIONS PRIOR TO OPENING AN ACCOUNT OR     INCREASING A CREDIT LINE. THIS REQUIRED MINOR ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR     ACCOUNT OPENING DECISIONING AND LINE INCREASE DECISIONING     PROCESSES. THIS REQUIREMENT BECAME EFFECTIVE ON     FEBRUARY 22, 2010, AND TO DATE HAS NOT HAD ANY SIGNIFICANT     IMPACT ON THESE DECISIONS. IN ADDITION, APPLICANTS FOR NEW     ACCOUNTS WHO ARE UNDER THE AGE OF 21 MUST DEMONSTRATE AN     INDEPENDENT ABILITY TO MAKE THE REQUIRED MINIMUM PERIODIC     PAYMENTS. ON OCTOBER 19, 2010, THE FEDERAL RESERVE PROPOSED     CLARIFICATIONS TO ITS RULES IMPLEMENTING THE CARD ACT, WHICH     WOULD INCLUDE A REQUIREMENT THAT APPLICANTS WHO ARE 21 AND OVER     MUST ALSO DEMONSTRATE AN INDEPENDENT ABILITY TO MAKE THE     REQUIRED MONTHLY MINIMUM PAYMENTS. ISSUERS WOULD NOT BE     PERMITTED TO CONSIDER HOUSEHOLD INCOME OR ASSETS, BUT ONLY THE     INDIVIDUAL INCOME OR ASSETS OF THE APPLICANT. IF ADOPTED AS     PROPOSED, THIS RULE MAY DECREASE THE NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS FOR     OUR CARDS THAT ARE APPROVED FOR APPLICANTS WHO DO NOT HAVE     SUFFICIENT INDIVIDUAL INCOME, EVEN          50    TABLE OF CONTENTS        THOUGH THEIR HOUSEHOLD INCOME MAY BE SUFFICIENT FOR APPROVAL.     SINCE AUGUST 22, 2010, THE CARD ACT REQUIRES THAT PENALTY     FEES BE REASONABLE AND PROPORTIONAL. WHILE THE COMPANY HAS     ADJUSTED PENALTY FEES (LATE FEES AND RETURNED PAYMENT FEES)     ACCORDINGLY, THIS REQUIREMENT IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE ANY     SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.         ALSO, SINCE AUGUST 22, 2010, THE CARD ACT REQUIRES ISSUERS     TO PERIODICALLY REEVALUATE APR INCREASES TO DETERMINE IF A     DECREASE IS APPROPRIATE. THE FIRST OF THESE REEVALUATIONS MUST     BE COMPLETED IN FEBRUARY 2011. THE OBLIGATION TO PERIODICALLY     REEVALUATE APR INCREASES IS ONGOING, AND IT IS UNCERTAIN HOW     THESE PROVISIONS WILL BE INTERPRETED OR AMENDED BY THE NEW     CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU. THEREFORE, WHILE THE     ULTIMATE IMPACT OF THIS REQUIREMENT IS UNCERTAIN AT THIS TIME,     IT COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.         THE FEDERAL RESERVE ALSO AMENDED ITS RULES ON THE FORMAT AND     CONTENT OF CONSUMER CREDIT CARD DISCLOSURES. THE AMENDMENTS     REQUIRED REVISIONS TO THE FORMAT AND CONTENT OF ALL MAIN TYPES     OF OPEN-END CONSUMER CREDIT DISCLOSURES, INCLUDING APPLICATIONS     AND SOLICITATIONS, ACCOUNT-OPENING DISCLOSURES, AND PERIODIC     BILLING STATEMENTS. THESE AMENDMENTS BECAME EFFECTIVE ON     JULY 1, 2010.         CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE CARD ACT ALSO APPLY TO STORED VALUE     AND PREPAID PRODUCTS SOLD ON OR AFTER AUGUST 22, 2010. IN     MARCH 2010, THE FEDERAL RESERVE AMENDED ITS REGULATION E TO     IMPOSE NEW RESTRICTIONS ON THE ABILITY TO IMPOSE DORMANCY,     INACTIVITY OR SERVICE FEES WITH RESPECT TO GIFT CERTIFICATES,     STORE GIFT CARDS AND GENERAL-USE PREPAID CARDS ISSUED PRIMARILY     FOR PERSONAL USE. SUCH FEES MAY ONLY BE IMPOSED UNDER CERTAIN     CONDITIONS. ADDITIONALLY, THE RULES PROHIBIT THE SALE OR     ISSUANCE OF A GIFT CERTIFICATE, STORE GIFT CARD OR GENERAL-USE     PREPAID CARD THAT HAS AN EXPIRATION DATE OF LESS THAN FIVE YEARS     AFTER EITHER THE DATE A CERTIFICATE OR CARD IS ISSUED OR THE     DATE ON WHICH FUNDS WERE LAST LOADED. THE RULES ALSO REQUIRE     IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO GIVE CONSUMERS A     REASONABLE OPPORTUNITY TO PURCHASE A CERTIFICATE OR CARD WITH AT     LEAST FIVE YEARS BEFORE THE CERTIFICATE OR CARD EXPIRATION DATE,     PROHIBIT ANY FEES FOR REPLACING AN EXPIRED CERTIFICATE OR CARD     OR REFUNDING THE REMAINING BALANCE AS LONG AS THE UNDERLYING     FUNDS REMAIN VALID, AND REQUIRE ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES FOR ANY     FEE OTHER THAN A DORMANCY, INACTIVITY OR SERVICE FEE.         WHILE THE COMPANY HAS MADE CERTAIN CHANGES TO OUR PRODUCT TERMS     AND PRACTICES DESIGNED TO COMPLY WITH THE CARD ACT, THE     LONG-TERM IMPACT OF THE CARD ACT ON THE COMPANY\\x92S BUSINESS     PRACTICES AND REVENUES WILL DEPEND UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS,     INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS     STRATEGIES, CONSUMER BEHAVIOR AND THE ACTIONS OF THE     COMPANY\\x92S COMPETITORS, WHICH ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AT     THIS TIME. IF THE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO LESSEN THE IMPACT OF     THE CHANGES REQUIRED BY THE CARD ACT, IT WILL HAVE A MATERIAL     ADVERSE EFFECT ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.     ANTI-MONEY     LAUNDERING COMPLIANCE         IN THE UNITED STATES, THE USA PATRIOT ACT WAS ENACTED IN OCTOBER     2001 IN THE WAKE OF THE SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 TERRORIST     ATTACKS. THE PATRIOT ACT, IN ADDITION TO SUBSTANTIALLY     BROADENING EXISTING AML AND TERRORIST FINANCING LEGISLATION,     AMENDED THE BANK SECRECY ACT, THE PRIMARY LEGISLATION GOVERNING     AML REQUIREMENTS. THE PATRIOT ACT CONTAINS A WIDE VARIETY OF     PROVISIONS AIMED AT FIGHTING TERRORISM AND MONEY LAUNDERING,     INCLUDING PROVISIONS AIMED AT IMPEDING TERRORISTS\\x92 ABILITY     TO ACCESS AND MOVE FUNDS USED IN SUPPORT OF TERRORIST     ACTIVITIES. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE BANK SECRECY ACT, AS AMENDED     BY THE PATRIOT ACT, REQUIRES FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO ESTABLISH     AML PROGRAMS THAT MEET CERTAIN STANDARDS, INCLUDING, IN SOME     INSTANCES, EXPANDED REPORTING AND ENHANCED INFORMATION GATHERING     AND RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENTS. WHILE AMERICAN EXPRESS HAS LONG     MAINTAINED AML PROGRAMS IN OUR BUSINESSES, CERTAIN OF OUR     BUSINESS ACTIVITIES ARE SUBJECT TO SPECIFIC AML REGULATIONS THAT     PRESCRIBE MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR COMPONENTS OF THE AML PROGRAMS.     FOR EXAMPLE, OUR GNS BUSINESS MAINTAINS A RISK-BASED PROGRAM TO     ENSURE THAT INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE LICENSED TO ISSUE CARDS OR     ACQUIRE MERCHANTS ON THEIR NETWORKS MAINTAIN ADEQUATE AML     CONTROLS. WE HAVE ALSO DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED A KNOW YOUR     CUSTOMER, OR DUE DILIGENCE, PROGRAM AND AN ENHANCED DUE     DILIGENCE PROGRAM, INCLUDING A PROGRAM FOR VERIFYING THE     IDENTITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS FOR APPLICABLE BUSINESSES. WE WILL     TAKE STEPS TO COMPLY WITH ANY ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS OR     INITIATIVES THAT ARE ADOPTED, WHETHER IN THE UNITED STATES OR IN     OTHER JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS.         51    TABLE OF CONTENTS        OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, THE INDUSTRY HAS SEEN INCREASED     REGULATORY SCRUTINY OF THE AML COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS OF FINANCIAL     INSTITUTIONS, WITH EMPHASIS ON RECORD KEEPING AND REPORTING     REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS THE REQUIREMENT TO IDENTIFY AND REPORT     SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY, LEADING TO ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AND     INCREASED PENALTIES FOR NON-COMPLIANCE. TO MEET THIS INCREASED     SCRUTINY, WE CONTINUE TO ENHANCE OUR ENTERPRISE-WIDE AML     COMPLIANCE PROGRAM. OUR AML COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS PRIMARILY     CONSIST OF RISK-BASED POLICIES, PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS THAT ARE     REASONABLY DESIGNED TO PREVENT, DETECT AND REPORT MONEY     LAUNDERING.         WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION, INCLUDING     A NUMBER OF REGULATED BUSINESSES. WE MONITOR DEVELOPMENTS IN EU     LEGISLATION, AS WELL AS IN THE OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE     OPERATE, TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE IN A POSITION TO COMPLY WITH ALL     APPLICABLE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING EUROPEAN UNION     DIRECTIVES APPLICABLE TO PAYMENT INSTITUTIONS, CREDIT PROVIDERS,     INSURANCE INTERMEDIARIES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.     OFFICE OF     FOREIGN ASSETS CONTROL REGULATION         THE UNITED STATES HAS IMPOSED ECONOMIC SANCTIONS THAT AFFECT     TRANSACTIONS WITH DESIGNATED FOREIGN COUNTRIES, NATIONALS AND     OTHERS. THESE ARE TYPICALLY KNOWN AS THE \\x93OFAC\\x94 RULES,     AND THEY ARE ADMINISTERED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF     TREASURY\\x92S OFFICE OF FOREIGN ASSETS CONTROL     (\\x93OFAC\\x94). THE OFAC-ADMINISTERED SANCTIONS TAKE MANY     DIFFERENT FORMS. GENERALLY, HOWEVER, THEY CONTAIN ONE OR MORE OF     THE FOLLOWING ELEMENTS: (I) RESTRICTIONS ON TRADE WITH OR     INVESTMENT IN A SANCTIONED COUNTRY, INCLUDING PROHIBITIONS     AGAINST DIRECT OR INDIRECT IMPORTS FROM AND EXPORTS TO A     SANCTIONED COUNTRY AND PROHIBITIONS ON     \\x93U.S. PERSONS\\x94 ENGAGING IN FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS     RELATING TO MAKING INVESTMENTS IN, OR PROVIDING     INVESTMENT-RELATED ADVICE OR ASSISTANCE TO, A SANCTIONED     COUNTRY; AND (II) A BLOCKING OF ASSETS IN WHICH THE     GOVERNMENT OR SPECIALLY DESIGNATED NATIONALS OF THE SANCTIONED     COUNTRY HAVE AN INTEREST, BY PROHIBITING TRANSFERS OF PROPERTY     SUBJECT TO U.S. JURISDICTION (INCLUDING PROPERTY IN THE     POSSESSION OR CONTROL OF U.S. PERSONS). BLOCKED ASSETS     (E.G., PROPERTY OR BANK DEPOSITS) CANNOT BE PAID OUT, WITHDRAWN,     SET OFF OR TRANSFERRED IN ANY MANNER WITHOUT A LICENSE FROM     OFAC. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESE SANCTIONS COULD HAVE SERIOUS     LEGAL AND REPUTATIONAL CONSEQUENCES.     COMPENSATION     PRACTICES         OUR COMPENSATION PRACTICES ARE SUBJECT TO OVERSIGHT BY THE     FEDERAL RESERVE. IN JUNE 2010, THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE OCC, THE     FDIC AND THE OTS JOINTLY ISSUED FINAL GUIDANCE ON SOUND     INCENTIVE COMPENSATION POLICIES THAT APPLIES TO ALL BANKING     ORGANIZATIONS SUPERVISED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, INCLUDING BANK     HOLDING COMPANIES, SUCH AS THE COMPANY, AS WELL AS ALL INSURED     DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB.     THE FINAL GUIDANCE SETS FORTH THREE KEY PRINCIPLES FOR INCENTIVE     COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO HELP ENSURE THAT     INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLANS DO NOT ENCOURAGE EXCESSIVE     RISK-TAKING AND ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS OF     BANKING ORGANIZATIONS. THE THREE PRINCIPLES PROVIDE THAT A     BANKING ORGANIZATION\\x92S INCENTIVE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS     SHOULD PROVIDE INCENTIVES THAT APPROPRIATELY BALANCE RISK AND     FINANCIAL RESULTS IN A MANNER THAT DOES NOT ENCOURAGE EMPLOYEES     TO EXPOSE THEIR ORGANIZATIONS TO IMPRUDENT RISKS, BE COMPATIBLE     WITH EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROLS AND RISK MANAGEMENT, AND BE     SUPPORTED BY STRONG CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, INCLUDING ACTIVE AND     EFFECTIVE OVERSIGHT BY THE ORGANIZATION\\x92S BOARD OF     DIRECTORS. ANY DEFICIENCIES IN COMPENSATION PRACTICES OF A     BANKING INSTITUTION THAT ARE IDENTIFIED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE     OR OTHER BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES IN CONNECTION WITH ITS REVIEW     OF SUCH ORGANIZATION\\x92S COMPENSATION PRACTICES MAY BE     INCORPORATED INTO THE ORGANIZATION\\x92S SUPERVISORY RATINGS,     WHICH CAN AFFECT ITS ABILITY TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS OR PERFORM     OTHER ACTIONS. THE FINAL GUIDANCE PROVIDES THAT ENFORCEMENT     ACTIONS MAY BE TAKEN AGAINST A BANKING ORGANIZATION IF ITS     INCENTIVE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS OR RELATED RISK-MANAGEMENT     CONTROL OR GOVERNANCE PROCESSES POSE A RISK TO THE     ORGANIZATION\\x92S SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS AND THE ORGANIZATION IS     NOT TAKING PROMPT AND EFFECTIVE MEASURES TO CORRECT THE     DEFICIENCIES.         ADDITIONALLY, ON FEBRUARY 7, 2011, THE FDIC APPROVED A     NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING PURSUANT TO DODD-FRANK ON     INCENTIVE-BASED COMPENSATION PRACTICES. THE PROPOSED RULE IS A     JOINT RULEMAKING BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE OCC, THE FDIC, THE     OTS, THE SEC, THE FEDERAL HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY AND THE     NATIONAL CREDIT UNION ADMINISTRATION, WHICH EACH MUST     INDEPENDENTLY APPROVE THE PROPOSED RULE BEFORE IT IS PUBLISHED     FOR COMMENT. UNDER THE PROPOSED RULE, ALL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS     WITH TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS OF $1 BILLION OR MORE (SUCH     AS THE COMPANY, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB) WOULD BE PROHIBITED     FROM OFFERING INCENTIVE-BASED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS THAT     ENCOURAGE INAPPROPRIATE RISK TAKING BY OFFERING     \\x93EXCESSIVE\\x94 COMPENSATION OR          52    TABLE OF CONTENTS        COMPENSATION THAT COULD LEAD THE COMPANY TO MATERIAL FINANCIAL     LOSS. ALL COVERED INSTITUTIONS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE     FEDERAL REGULATORS WITH ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES TO DETERMINE     COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROPOSED RULE AND ALSO TO MAINTAIN POLICIES     AND PROCEDURES TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE. ADDITIONALLY, FOR COVERED     INSTITUTIONS WITH AT LEAST $50 BILLION IN TOTAL     CONSOLIDATED ASSETS, SUCH AS THE COMPANY, THE PROPOSED RULE     REQUIRES THAT AT LEAST 50% OF CERTAIN EXECUTIVE OFFICERS\\x92     INCENTIVE-BASED COMPENSATION BE DEFERRED FOR A MINIMUM OF THREE     YEARS AND PROVIDES FOR THE ADJUSTMENT OF DEFERRED PAYMENTS TO     REFLECT ACTUAL LOSSES OR OTHER MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE THAT     BECOME KNOWN DURING THE DEFERRAL PERIOD. MOREOVER, THE BOARD OF     DIRECTORS OF A COVERED INSTITUTION WITH AT LEAST     $50 BILLION IN TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS MUST IDENTIFY     EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE AUTHORITY TO EXPOSE AN INSTITUTION TO     SUBSTANTIAL RISK, EVALUATE AND DOCUMENT THE INCENTIVE-BASED     COMPENSATION METHODS USED TO BALANCE RISK AND FINANCIAL REWARDS     FOR THE IDENTIFIED EMPLOYEES, AND APPROVE INCENTIVE-BASED     COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS FOR THOSE EMPLOYEES AFTER     APPROPRIATELY CONSIDERING OTHER AVAILABLE METHODS FOR BALANCING     RISK AND FINANCIAL REWARDS. THE FORM AND TIMING OF ANY FINAL     RULE CANNOT BE DETERMINED AT THIS TIME.         OUR COMPENSATION PRACTICES ARE AFFECTED BY DODD-FRANK AMENDMENTS     TO THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 (THE \\x93EXCHANGE     ACT\\x94) REQUIRING A NON-BINDING     \\x93SAY-ON-PAY\\x94     VOTE TO BE PROVIDED AT LEAST ONCE EVERY THREE YEARS AT A     SHAREHOLDERS\\x92 MEETING AND A NON-BINDING SHAREHOLDER VOTE TO     BE PROVIDED AT LEAST ONCE EVERY SIX YEARS TO DETERMINE THE     FREQUENCY OF     SAY-ON-PAY     VOTES. THESE VOTES MUST BE PROVIDED AT MEETINGS OF SHAREHOLDERS     OCCURRING AFTER JANUARY 21, 2011. IN ADDITION, DODD-FRANK     REQUIRES PROXY STATEMENT DISCLOSURE OF COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS     REQUIRING PAYMENTS TO NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS UPON A CHANGE IN     CONTROL (\\x93GOLDEN PARACHUTES\\x94) IF SHAREHOLDERS ARE     VOTING ON A MERGER OR SIMILAR TRANSACTION, AS WELL AS A SEPARATE     NON-BINDING VOTE TO APPROVE GOLDEN PARACHUTE COMPENSATION     ARRANGEMENTS THAT HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY BEEN SUBJECT TO A     SAY-ON-PAY     VOTE. THE GOLDEN PARACHUTE DISCLOSURE AND VOTE IS REQUIRED IN     PROXY STATEMENTS AND OTHER SCHEDULES AND FORMS INITIALLY FILED     ON OR AFTER APRIL 25, 2011.         THE SCOPE AND CONTENT OF THESE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS ON     EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ARE CONTINUING TO DEVELOP AND ARE LIKELY     TO CONTINUE EVOLVING IN THE NEAR FUTURE. IT CANNOT BE DETERMINED     AT THIS TIME WHETHER COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH POLICIES AND     REGULATIONS WILL ADVERSELY AFFECT THE ABILITY OF AMERICAN     EXPRESS AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES TO HIRE, RETAIN AND MOTIVATE ITS     AND THEIR KEY EMPLOYEES.     FOREIGN     CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT         OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO COMPLEX     INTERNATIONAL AND U.S. LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING THE     FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT (THE \\x93FCPA\\x94) AND LOCAL     LAWS THAT PROHIBIT THE MAKING OR OFFERING OF IMPROPER PAYMENTS     TO FOREIGN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, POLITICAL PARTIES OR POLITICAL     PARTY OFFICIALS FOR THE PURPOSE OF OBTAINING OR RETAINING     BUSINESS OR AN IMPROPER ADVANTAGE. THE ANTI-CORRUPTION     PROVISIONS OF THE FCPA ARE ENFORCED BY DOJ. THE FCPA ALSO     REQUIRES US TO STRICTLY COMPLY WITH CERTAIN ACCOUNTING AND     INTERNAL CONTROLS STANDARDS ENFORCED BY THE SEC. IN RECENT     YEARS, DOJ AND SEC ENFORCEMENT OF THE FCPA HAS BECOME MORE     INTENSE. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE FCPA AND OTHER LAWS CAN     EXPOSE US AND/OR INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEES TO POTENTIALLY SEVERE     CRIMINAL AND CIVIL PENALTIES. THE RISK MAY BE GREATER WHEN WE     TRANSACT BUSINESS, WHETHER THROUGH SUBSIDIARIES OR JOINT     VENTURES OR OTHER PARTNERSHIPS, IN COUNTRIES WITH HIGHER     PERCEIVED LEVELS OF CORRUPTION. WE HAVE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES     DESIGNED TO DETECT AND DETER PROHIBITED PRACTICES, PROVIDE     SPECIALIZED TRAINING, MONITOR OUR OPERATIONS AND PAYMENTS     GLOBALLY, AND INVESTIGATE ALLEGATIONS OF IMPROPRIETIES RELATING     TO TRANSACTIONS AND THE MANNER IN WHICH TRANSACTIONS ARE     RECORDED. HOWEVER, IF OUR EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS OR AGENTS FAIL     TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS GOVERNING OUR INTERNATIONAL     OPERATIONS, THE COMPANY, AS WELL AS INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEES, MAY     FACE INVESTIGATIONS OR PROSECUTIONS, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL     ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF     OPERATIONS.      FOREIGN     OPERATIONS          WE DERIVE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUES FROM THE USE OF     OUR CARD PRODUCTS, TRAVELERS CHEQUES, TRAVEL AND OTHER FINANCIAL     PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND     CONTINUE TO BROADEN THE USE OF THESE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES     OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

CARDMEMBER LOAN AND CARDMEMBER     RECEIVABLE CONCENTRATIONS ARE DEFINED AS CARDMEMBER LOANS AND     CARDMEMBER RECEIVABLES DUE FROM MULTIPLE BORROWERS ENGAGED IN     SIMILAR ACTIVITIES THAT WOULD CAUSE THESE BORROWERS TO BE     IMPACTED SIMILARLY TO CERTAIN ECONOMIC OR OTHER RELATED     CONDITIONS.

(C)        BECAUSE CHARGE CARD PRODUCTS HAVE NO PRESET SPENDING LIMIT, THE     ASSOCIATED CREDIT LIMIT ON CARDMEMBER RECEIVABLES IS NOT     QUANTIFIABLE. THEREFORE, THE QUANTIFIED UNUSED     LINE-OF-CREDIT     AMOUNTS ONLY INCLUDE THE APPROXIMATE CREDIT LINE AVAILABLE ON     CARDMEMBER LOANS (INCLUDING BOTH FOR ON-BALANCE SHEET LOANS AND     LOANS PREVIOUSLY SECURITIZED).

AS A RESULT OF THESE CHANGES, AMOUNTS AS OF DECEMBER 31,     2010 INCLUDE IMPAIRED LOANS AND RECEIVABLES FOR BOTH THE CHARGE     TRUST AND LENDING TRUST; CORRESPONDINGLY, AMOUNTS AS OF     DECEMBER 31, 2009 ONLY INCLUDE IMPAIRED LOANS AND     RECEIVABLES FOR THE CHARGE TRUST AND THE SELLER\\x92S INTEREST     PORTION OF THE LENDING TRUST. AMOUNTS AS OF BOTH BALANCE SHEET     DATES ALSO INCLUDE IMPAIRED LOANS AND RECEIVABLES ASSOCIATED     WITH OTHER NON-SECURITIZED PORTFOLIOS.          (B)        THE COMPANY\\x92S POLICY IS GENERALLY TO CEASE ACCRUING     INTEREST INCOME ONCE A RELATED CARDMEMBER LOAN IS 180 DAYS     PAST DUE AT WHICH TIME THE CARDMEMBER LOAN IS WRITTEN OFF. THE     COMPANY ESTABLISHES LOAN LOSS RESERVES FOR ESTIMATED     UNCOLLECTIBLE INTEREST RECEIVABLE BALANCES PRIOR TO WRITE-OFF.     BEGINNING WITH 2009, CERTAIN CARDMEMBER LOANS PLACED WITH     OUTSIDE COLLECTION AGENCIES ARE PUT ON NON-ACCRUAL STATUS.          (C)        AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, THESE AMOUNTS PRIMARILY INCLUDE     CERTAIN CARDMEMBER LOANS PLACED WITH OUTSIDE COLLECTION     AGENCIES. NON-ACCRUAL LOANS AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005     INCLUDED A SINGLE LOAN TO A U.S. COMMERCIAL AIRLINE OF     APPROXIMATELY $104 MILLION AND $266 MILLION,     RESPECTIVELY, WHICH WAS PAID OFF IN FULL DURING THE SECOND     QUARTER OF 2007. THE LOAN WAS PUT ON NON-ACCRUAL STATUS IN THE     THIRD QUARTER OF 2005.          (D)        REPRESENTS LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM MODIFICATION PROGRAMS OR     TDRS, WHEREIN THE TERMS OF A LOAN OR RECEIVABLE HAVE BEEN     MODIFIED FOR CARDMEMBERS THAT ARE EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL     DIFFICULTIES AND A CONCESSION HAS BEEN GRANTED TO THE BORROWER.     THE COMPANY MAY MODIFY CARDMEMBER LOANS AND RECEIVABLES AND SUCH     MODIFICATIONS MAY INCLUDE REDUCING THE INTEREST RATE/DELINQUENCY     FEES ON THE LOANS AND RECEIVABLES AND/OR PLACING THE CARDMEMBER     ON A FIXED PAYMENT PLAN NOT EXCEEDING 60 MONTHS. IF THE     CARDMEMBER DOES NOT COMPLY WITH THE MODIFIED TERMS, THEN THE     LOAN OR RECEIVABLE AGREEMENT REVERTS BACK TO ITS ORIGINAL TERMS.          (E)        CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS OF PRIOR YEAR AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN MADE     TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT PRESENTATION.

(B)        IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2008, THE COMPANY REVISED ITS METHOD OF     REPORTING THE CARDMEMBER LENDING NET WRITE-OFF RATE.     HISTORICALLY, THE NET WRITE-OFF RATE HAS BEEN PRESENTED USING     NET WRITE-OFF AMOUNTS FOR PRINCIPAL, INTEREST, AND FEES.     HOWEVER, INDUSTRY CONVENTION IS GENERALLY TO INCLUDE ONLY THE     NET WRITE-OFFS RELATED TO PRINCIPAL IN WRITE-OFF RATE     DISCLOSURES. THE WRITE-OFF RATE FOR 2010, 2009, 2008 AND 2007 IS     A PRINCIPAL ONLY WRITE-OFF RATE CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY     CONVENTION. THE WRITE-OFF RATE FOR 2006 REFLECTS PRINCIPAL ONLY     WRITE-OFFS IN THE U.S. AND TOTAL WRITE-OFFS (PRINCIPAL,     INTEREST, AND FEES) OUTSIDE THE U.S. AS PRINCIPAL ONLY WRITE-OFF     INFORMATION WAS NOT AVAILABLE OUTSIDE THE U.S. FOR 2006.          (C)        FOR PURPOSES OF CALCULATING THE NET WRITE-OFF RATE IN ACCORDANCE     WITH (B) ABOVE, NET WRITE-OFFS WERE $3.3 BILLION,     $2.9 BILLION, $2.6 BILLION, $1.6 BILLION,     $1.2 BILLION FOR     2010-2006,     RESPECTIVELY.          (D)        INCLUDES $160 MILLION OF RESERVES IN 2009, THAT WERE     REMOVED IN CONNECTION WITH SECURITIZATIONS DURING THE YEAR. THE     OFFSET IS IN THE ALLOCATED COST OF THE ASSOCIATED RETAINED     SUBORDINATED SECURITIES. THIS AMOUNT ALSO INCLUDES FOREIGN     CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS. THE PRIOR YEARS INCLUDED     FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS PRIMARILY     RELATED TO THE RECLASSIFICATION OF WAIVED FEE RESERVES TO A     CONTRA-CARDMEMBER LOAN.

ITEM 1A.     RISK     FACTORS           THIS SECTION HIGHLIGHTS SPECIFIC RISKS THAT COULD AFFECT OUR     COMPANY AND ITS BUSINESSES. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER EACH     OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS AND ALL OF THE OTHER INFORMATION SET     FORTH IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON     FORM 10-K.     BASED ON THE INFORMATION CURRENTLY KNOWN TO US, WE BELIEVE THE     FOLLOWING INFORMATION IDENTIFIES THE MOST SIGNIFICANT RISK     FACTORS AFFECTING OUR COMPANY. HOWEVER, THE RISKS AND     UNCERTAINTIES OUR COMPANY FACES ARE NOT LIMITED TO THOSE     DESCRIBED BELOW. ADDITIONAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES NOT     PRESENTLY KNOWN TO US OR THAT WE CURRENTLY BELIEVE TO BE     IMMATERIAL MAY ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.         IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES DEVELOPS INTO     ACTUAL EVENTS OR IF THE CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED IN THE RISKS AND     UNCERTAINTIES OCCUR OR CONTINUE TO OCCUR, THESE EVENTS OR     CIRCUMSTANCES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR     BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THESE     EVENTS COULD ALSO HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE TRADING PRICE OF     OUR SECURITIES.     CURRENT     ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL RISKS     DIFFICULT     CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS AND ECONOMY GENERALLY,     AS WELL AS POLITICAL CONDITIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND     ELSEWHERE, MAY MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND     RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.         OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CONDITIONS     IN THE GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS AND THE ECONOMY GENERALLY, BOTH IN     THE UNITED STATES AND ELSEWHERE AROUND THE WORLD.         73    TABLE OF CONTENTS        ONGOING CONCERNS OVER THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF CREDIT, THE     MORTGAGE AND REAL ESTATE MARKETS, SOVEREIGN DEBT CRISES, FEAR OF     A DOUBLE-DIP RECESSION AND GEOPOLITICAL ISSUES HAVE CONTRIBUTED     TO UNCERTAIN EXPECTATIONS FOR THE ECONOMY AND THE MARKETS GOING     FORWARD. THESE FACTORS, COMBINED WITH STILL RELATIVELY LOW     LEVELS OF CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND RELATIVELY HIGH LEVELS OF     UNEMPLOYMENT, CONTINUE TO IMPACT GLOBAL ECONOMIES. THIS     ENVIRONMENT HAS HAD, AND MAY CONTINUE TO HAVE, AN ADVERSE EFFECT     ON US, IN PART BECAUSE WE ARE VERY DEPENDENT UPON CONSUMER AND     BUSINESS BEHAVIOR. IF THE ECONOMY WERE TO WORSEN, CUSTOMER     BEHAVIORS COULD CHANGE FURTHER. FOR EXAMPLE, CARDMEMBERS COULD     DECIDE TO REDEEM MEMBERSHIP REWARDS POINTS AT ABNORMALLY HIGH     LEVELS TO REPLACE CASH EXPENDITURES.         FACTORS SUCH AS CONSUMER SPENDING, BUSINESS INVESTMENT,     GOVERNMENT SPENDING, INTEREST RATES, THE VOLATILITY AND STRENGTH     OF THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND INFLATION ALL AFFECT THE BUSINESS AND     ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND, ULTIMATELY, OUR PROFITABILITY. AN     ECONOMIC DOWNTURN CHARACTERIZED BY HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT, LOWER     FAMILY INCOME, LOWER CORPORATE EARNINGS, LOWER BUSINESS     INVESTMENT AND LOWER CONSUMER SPENDING IS LIKELY TO MATERIALLY     AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND     FINANCIAL CONDITION. FURTHERMORE, THE FACTORS DISCUSSED ABOVE     MAY CAUSE OUR EARNINGS, CREDIT METRICS AND MARGINS TO FLUCTUATE     AND DIVERGE FROM EXPECTATIONS OF ANALYSTS AND INVESTORS, WHO MAY     HAVE DIFFERING ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING THEIR IMPACT ON OUR     BUSINESS, AND MAY IMPACT THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON SHARES.         POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC INSTABILITY IN CERTAIN REGIONS OR     COUNTRIES COULD ALSO AFFECT OUR COMMERCIAL OR OTHER LENDING     ACTIVITIES, AMONG OTHER BUSINESSES, OR RESULT IN RESTRICTIONS ON     CONVERTIBILITY OF CERTAIN CURRENCIES. IN ADDITION, OUR TRAVEL     NETWORK MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY WORLD GEOPOLITICAL AND     OTHER CONDITIONS. TRAVEL EXPENDITURES ARE SENSITIVE TO BUSINESS     AND PERSONAL DISCRETIONARY SPENDING LEVELS AND TEND TO DECLINE     DURING GENERAL ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS.         TERRORIST ATTACKS, INTRUSION INTO OUR INFRASTRUCTURE BY     \\x93HACKERS\\x94 OR OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENTS MAY HAVE A     NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. BECAUSE OF OUR PROXIMITY TO THE     WORLD TRADE CENTER, OUR HEADQUARTERS WERE DAMAGED AS A RESULT OF     THE TERRORIST ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001. SIMILAR EVENTS     OR OTHER DISASTERS OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS IN THE FUTURE COULD     HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESSES AND INFRASTRUCTURE,     INCLUDING OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS. BECAUSE WE DERIVE     A PORTION OF OUR REVENUES FROM TRAVEL-RELATED SPENDING, OUR     BUSINESS WILL BE SENSITIVE TO SAFETY CONCERNS, AND THUS IS     LIKELY TO DECLINE DURING PERIODS IN WHICH TRAVELERS BECOME     CONCERNED ABOUT SAFETY ISSUES OR WHEN TRAVEL MIGHT INVOLVE     HEALTH-RELATED RISKS.         WE HELD APPROXIMATELY $5.8 BILLION OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES     OF STATE AND MUNICIPAL OBLIGATIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010.     IN THE EVENT THAT ACTUAL DEFAULT RATES OF THESE INVESTMENT     SECURITIES WERE TO SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE FROM HISTORICAL PATTERNS     DUE TO CHALLENGES IN THE ECONOMY OR OTHERWISE, IT COULD HAVE A     MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.         IF THE CONDITIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE (OR SIMILAR ONES) WERE TO     PERSIST OR WORSEN, WE COULD EXPERIENCE CONTINUING OR INCREASED     ADVERSE EFFECTS ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL     CONDITION.     ADVERSE     CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKET CONDITIONS MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT     OUR ABILITY TO MEET LIQUIDITY NEEDS, ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND COST     OF CAPITAL.         THE GLOBAL MONEY AND CAPITAL MARKETS, WHILE DEMONSTRATING     GENERALLY IMPROVED CONDITIONS, REMAIN SUSCEPTIBLE TO VOLATILITY     AND DISRUPTION, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT MARKET LIQUIDITY     CONDITIONS.         WE NEED LIQUIDITY TO PAY MERCHANTS, OPERATING EXPENSES, INTEREST     ON DEBT AND DIVIDENDS ON CAPITAL STOCK AND TO REPAY MATURING     LIABILITIES. WITHOUT SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY, WE COULD BE FORCED TO     LIMIT OUR INVESTMENTS IN GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES OR CURTAIL     OPERATIONS. THE PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF OUR LIQUIDITY ARE PAYMENTS     FROM CARDMEMBERS AND MERCHANTS, CASH FLOW FROM OUR INVESTMENT     PORTFOLIO AND ASSETS, CONSISTING MAINLY OF CASH OR ASSETS THAT     ARE READILY CONVERTIBLE INTO CASH, DIRECT AND THIRD-PARTY     DISTRIBUTED DEPOSITS, DEBT INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS UNSECURED MEDIUM-     AND LONG-TERM NOTES AND ASSET SECURITIZATIONS, SECURITIZED     BORROWINGS THROUGH OUR CONDUIT FACILITY, THE FEDERAL RESERVE     DISCOUNT WINDOW AND LONG-TERM COMMITTED BANK BORROWING     FACILITIES IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.         NOTWITHSTANDING OUR SOLID FINANCIAL POSITION, WE ARE NOT IMMUNE     FROM PRESSURES EXPERIENCED BROADLY ACROSS THE FINANCIAL MARKETS.     THE FRAGILITY OF THE CREDIT MARKETS AND THE CURRENT ECONOMIC AND     REGULATORY          74    TABLE OF CONTENTS        ENVIRONMENT HAVE IMPACTED FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES. ALTHOUGH     THE MARKET FOR OUR UNSECURED TERM DEBT AND ASSET SECURITIZATIONS     HAS IMPROVED, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE MARKETS WILL BE     OPEN TO US IN THE FUTURE. THEREFORE, OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN     FINANCING IN THE DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS FOR UNSECURED TERM DEBT     AND ASSET SECURITIZATIONS IS DEPENDENT ON INVESTOR DEMAND. IN     ADDITION, OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION WILL BE IMPACTED BY OUR ABILITY     TO MEET OUR OBJECTIVES WITH RESPECT TO THE MAINTENANCE AND     GROWTH OF OUR DIRECT AND THIRD-PARTY DISTRIBUTED DEPOSIT     PROGRAMS. WE ALSO WOULD HAVE LESS FLEXIBILITY IN ACCESSING THE     COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET AS A SHORT-TERM FUNDING VEHICLE IN THE     EVENT OF A DOWNGRADE IN CREDCO\\x92S SHORT-TERM DEBT RATING AND     VOLATILITY IN THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET GENERALLY.         IN THE EVENT THAT CURRENT SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY, INCLUDING     INTERNAL SOURCES, DO NOT SATISFY OUR NEEDS, WE WOULD BE REQUIRED     TO SEEK ADDITIONAL FINANCING. THE AVAILABILITY OF ADDITIONAL     FINANCING WILL DEPEND ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS SUCH AS MARKET     CONDITIONS, THE GENERAL AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT AND CONSUMER     DEPOSITS, THE OVERALL AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT TO THE FINANCIAL     SERVICES INDUSTRY, OUR CREDIT RATINGS (WHICH WERE DOWNGRADED IN     APRIL 2009 BY TWO OF THE MAJOR RATINGS AGENCIES), AND CREDIT     CAPACITY, AS WELL AS THE POSSIBILITY THAT LENDERS OR DEPOSITORS     COULD DEVELOP A NEGATIVE PERCEPTION OF OUR LONG- OR SHORT-TERM     FINANCIAL PROSPECTS IF WE INCUR LARGE CREDIT LOSSES OR IF THE     LEVEL OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITY DECREASES DUE TO AN ECONOMIC     DOWNTURN.         SIMILARLY, OUR ACCESS TO FUNDS MAY BE IMPAIRED IF REGULATORY     AUTHORITIES OR RATING AGENCIES TAKE NEGATIVE ACTIONS AGAINST US.     WHILE WE HAVE EXPERIENCED POSITIVE CREDIT TRENDS SINCE THE     LATTER HALF OF 2009, IF THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR CHARGE CARD AND     CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIOS WERE TO WEAKEN THROUGH INCREASING     DELINQUENCIES AND WRITE-OFFS, OUR LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM DEBT     RATINGS COULD BE DOWNGRADED AND OUR ACCESS TO CAPITAL COULD BE     MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND OUR COST OF CAPITAL COULD     INCREASE. DISRUPTIONS, UNCERTAINTY OR VOLATILITY IN THE CAPITAL     AND CREDIT MARKETS MAY ALSO LIMIT OUR ACCESS TO CAPITAL REQUIRED     TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS. SUCH MARKET CONDITIONS MAY LIMIT OUR     ABILITY TO REPLACE, IN A TIMELY MANNER, MATURING LIABILITIES,     SATISFY REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND ACCESS THE CAPITAL     NECESSARY TO GROW OUR BUSINESS. AS SUCH, WE MAY BE FORCED TO     DELAY RAISING CAPITAL OR BEAR AN UNATTRACTIVE COST TO RAISE     CAPITAL, WHICH COULD DECREASE PROFITABILITY AND SIGNIFICANTLY     REDUCE FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY. IF LEVELS OF MARKET DISRUPTION AND     VOLATILITY WORSEN, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL NOT     EXPERIENCE AN ADVERSE EFFECT, WHICH MAY BE MATERIAL, ON OUR     ABILITY TO ACCESS CAPITAL AND ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL     CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.         FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING NEEDS, SEE     \\x93FINANCIAL REVIEW \\x97 FUNDING PROGRAMS AND     ACTIVITIES\\x94 ON PAGES 42-46 OF OUR 2010 ANNUAL REPORT     TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH INFORMATION IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY     REFERENCE.     WE CAN     BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE IMPAIRMENT OF OTHER FINANCIAL     INSTITUTIONS.         OUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN ROUTINE FUNDING TRANSACTIONS COULD BE     ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE ACTIONS AND COMMERCIAL SOUNDNESS OF     OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES INSTITUTIONS. FINANCIAL SERVICES     INSTITUTIONS ARE INTERRELATED AS A RESULT OF TRADING, CLEARING,     COUNTERPARTY OR OTHER RELATIONSHIPS. WE ROUTINELY EXECUTE     TRANSACTIONS WITH COUNTERPARTIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES     INDUSTRY, INCLUDING COMMERCIAL BANKS, INVESTMENT BANKS AND     INSURANCE COMPANIES. DEFAULTS OR NON-PERFORMANCE BY, OR EVEN     RUMORS OR QUESTIONS ABOUT, ONE OR MORE FINANCIAL SERVICES     INSTITUTIONS, OR THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY GENERALLY, HAVE     LED TO MARKET-WIDE LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS AND COULD LEAD TO LOSSES     OR DEFAULTS BY ONE OR MORE OF OUR COUNTERPARTIES, WHICH, IN     TURN, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF     OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.     ANY     REDUCTION IN THE COMPANY\\x92S AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\\x92     CREDIT RATINGS COULD INCREASE THE COST OF OUR FUNDING FROM, AND     RESTRICT OUR ACCESS TO, THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND HAVE A MATERIAL     ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL     CONDITION.         ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY\\x92S AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\\x92 LONG-TERM     DEBT IS CURRENTLY RATED INVESTMENT GRADE BY THE MAJOR RATING     AGENCIES, THE RATINGS OF THAT DEBT WERE DOWNGRADED DURING THE     SECOND QUARTER OF 2009 BY MOODY\\x92S INVESTORS SERVICES     (\\x93MOODY\\x92S\\x94) AND STANDARD & POOR\\x92S     (\\x93S&P\\x94), TWO OF THE MAJOR RATING AGENCIES. THE     RATING AGENCIES REGULARLY EVALUATE THE COMPANY AND ITS     SUBSIDIARIES, AND THEIR RATINGS OF THE COMPANY\\x92S AND ITS     SUBSIDIARIES\\x92 LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM DEBT ARE BASED ON A     NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THEIR FINANCIAL STRENGTH AS WELL AS     FACTORS NOT ENTIRELY WITHIN THEIR CONTROL, INCLUDING CONDITIONS     AFFECTING THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY          75    TABLE OF CONTENTS        GENERALLY, AND THE WIDER STATE OF THE ECONOMY. THERE CAN BE NO     ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES WILL MAINTAIN     THEIR CURRENT RESPECTIVE RATINGS. FAILURE TO MAINTAIN THOSE     RATINGS COULD, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ADVERSELY LIMIT OUR ACCESS TO     THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COST AND OTHER     TERMS UPON WHICH THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE ABLE TO     OBTAIN FUNDING.         THE ABILITY OF ISSUERS OF ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES TO OBTAIN     NECESSARY CREDIT RATINGS FOR THEIR ISSUANCES HAS HISTORICALLY     BEEN BASED, IN PART, ON QUALIFICATION UNDER THE FDIC\\x92S SAFE     HARBOR RULE FOR ASSETS TRANSFERRED IN SECURITIZATIONS. IN 2009     AND 2010, THE FDIC ISSUED A SERIES OF CHANGES TO ITS SAFE HARBOR     RULE, WITH ITS NEW FINAL RULE FOR ITS SECURITIZATION SAFE     HARBOR, ISSUED IN 2010, REQUIRING ISSUERS TO COMPLY WITH A NEW     SET OF REQUIREMENTS IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR THE SAFE HARBOR.     ISSUANCES OUT OF OUR AMERICAN EXPRESS CREDIT ACCOUNT MASTER     TRUST ARE \\x93GRANDFATHERED\\x94 UNDER THE NEW FDIC FINAL     RULE. THE TRUST FOR THE COMPANY\\x92S CARDMEMBER CHARGE     RECEIVABLE SECURITIZATION (THE \\x93CHARGE TRUST\\x94) DOES     NOT SATISFY THE CRITERIA REQUIRED TO BE COVERED BY THE     FDIC\\x92S NEW SAFE HARBOR RULE, NOR DID IT MEET THE     REQUIREMENTS TO BE COVERED BY THE SAFE HARBOR RULE EXISTING     PRIOR TO 2009. IT WAS STRUCTURED AND CONTINUES TO BE STRUCTURED     SUCH THAT THE FINANCIAL ASSETS TRANSFERRED TO THE CHARGE TRUST     WOULD NOT BE DEEMED TO BE PROPERTY OF THE ORIGINATING BANKS IN     THE EVENT THE FDIC IS APPOINTED AS A RECEIVER OR CONSERVATOR OF     THE ORIGINATING BANKS. THE COMPANY HAS RECEIVED CONFIRMATION     FROM MOODY\\x92S, S&P AND FITCH RATINGS, WHICH RATE     ISSUANCES FROM THE CHARGE TRUST, THAT THEY WILL CONTINUE TO RATE     ISSUANCES FROM THE CHARGE TRUST IN THE SAME MANNER AS THEY HAVE     HISTORICALLY, EVEN THOUGH THEY DO NOT SATISFY THE REQUIREMENTS     TO BE COVERED BY THE FDIC\\x92S SAFE HARBOR RULE. NEVERTHELESS,     ONE OR MORE OF THE RATING AGENCIES MAY ULTIMATELY CONCLUDE THAT     IN THE ABSENCE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE SAFE HARBOR RULE, THE     HIGHEST RATING A CHARGE TRUST SECURITY COULD RECEIVE WOULD BE     BASED ON THE ORIGINATING BANK\\x92S UNSECURED DEBT RATING. IF     ONE OR MORE RATING AGENCIES COME TO THIS CONCLUSION, IT COULD     ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPANY\\x92S CAPACITY AND COST OF USING     ITS CHARGE TRUST AS A SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR ITS BUSINESS.         WE CANNOT PREDICT WHAT ACTIONS RATING AGENCIES MAY TAKE. AS WITH     OTHER COMPANIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, THE     COMPANY\\x92S AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\\x92 RATINGS COULD BE     DOWNGRADED AT ANY TIME AND WITHOUT ANY NOTICE BY ANY OF THE     RATING AGENCIES.     ADVERSE     CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTROLS COULD     DECREASE REVENUE WE RECEIVE FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL     OPERATIONS.         DURING 2010, OVER 33% OF OUR REVENUE NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE WAS     GENERATED FROM ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. WE ARE     EXPOSED TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL     OPERATIONS, AND SOME OF THE REVENUE WE GENERATE OUTSIDE THE     UNITED STATES IS SUBJECT TO UNPREDICTABLE AND INDETERMINATE     FLUCTUATIONS IF THE VALUES OF OTHER CURRENCIES CHANGE RELATIVE     TO THE U.S. DOLLAR. RESULTING EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES ARE     INCLUDED IN OUR NET INCOME. FURTHERMORE, WE MAY BECOME SUBJECT     TO EXCHANGE CONTROL REGULATIONS THAT MIGHT RESTRICT OR PROHIBIT     THE CONVERSION OF OUR OTHER REVENUE CURRENCIES INTO     U.S. DOLLARS. THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THESE EVENTS OR     CIRCUMSTANCES COULD DECREASE THE REVENUES WE RECEIVE FROM OUR     INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON     OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.     LEGAL AND     REGULATORY RISKS     ONGOING     LEGAL PROCEEDINGS REGARDING THE COMPANY\\x92S     \\x93ANTI-STEERING\\x94 AND SURCHARGING-RELATED CONTRACTUAL     PROVISIONS COULD REQUIRE CHANGES TO THOSE PROVISIONS THAT COULD     RESULT IN A MATERIAL LOSS OF REVENUE OR INCREASED EXPENSES,     SUBSTANTIAL MONETARY JUDGMENTS AND/OR DAMAGE TO THE     COMPANY\\x92S GLOBAL REPUTATION AND BRAND.         THE DOJ AND CERTAIN STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL HAVE RECENTLY     BROUGHT AN ACTION AGAINST THE COMPANY ALLEGING THAT THE     PROVISIONS IN THE COMPANY\\x92S CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENTS WITH     MERCHANTS THAT PROHIBIT MERCHANTS FROM DISCRIMINATING AGAINST     THE COMPANY\\x92S CARD PRODUCTS AT THE POINT OF SALE VIOLATE     THE U.S. ANTITRUST LAWS. VISA AND MASTERCARD ARE ALSO     DEFENDANTS IN THIS PROCEEDING, BUT THEY HAVE ENTERED INTO A     PROPOSED SETTLEMENT, WHICH IS SUBJECT TO JUDICIAL REVIEW AND     APPROVAL FOLLOWING A COMMENT PERIOD. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS     A DEFENDANT IN A NUMBER OF ACTIONS, INCLUDING PROPOSED CLASS     ACTIONS, FILED BY MERCHANTS THAT CHALLENGE THE COMPANY\\x92S     \\x93ANTI-STEERING\\x94 PROVISIONS AS WELL AS     SURCHARGING-RELATED PROVISIONS. VISA AND MASTERCARD HAVE BEEN     NAMED AS DEFENDANTS IN LAWSUITS THAT INCLUDE SIMILAR ALLEGATIONS     RELATING TO THEIR \\x93ANTI-STEERING\\x94     AND/OR          76    TABLE OF CONTENTS        SURCHARGING-RELATED POLICIES AND RULES. A DESCRIPTION OF THESE     LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IS CONTAINED IN \\x93LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\\x94     BELOW. AN ADVERSE OUTCOME IN ANY OF THESE PROCEEDINGS AGAINST     THE COMPANY COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY IMPACT THE     PROFITABILITY OF THE COMPANY, REQUIRE IT TO CHANGE ITS MERCHANT     AGREEMENTS IN A WAY THAT COULD EXPOSE THE COMPANY\\x92S CARD     PRODUCTS TO STEERING OR OTHER FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION AT THE     POINT OF SALE THAT WOULD IMPAIR OUR CARDMEMBER\\x92S     EXPERIENCE, RESULT IN THE IMPOSITION OF SUBSTANTIAL MONETARY     DAMAGES     AND/OR     DAMAGE THE COMPANY\\x92S GLOBAL REPUTATION AND BRAND. EVEN IF     THE COMPANY WERE NOT REQUIRED TO CHANGE ITS MERCHANT AGREEMENTS,     CHANGES IN VISA AND MASTERCARD\\x92S POLICIES OR PRACTICES AS A     RESULT OF ANY SUCH LEGAL PROCEEDINGS OR REGULATORY ACTIONS COULD     SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO MARKET PRESSURES THAT COULD MATERIALLY     AND ADVERSELY IMPACT ITS PROFITABILITY.     THE     DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT MAY     HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF     OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.         IN JULY 2010, PRESIDENT OBAMA SIGNED INTO LAW DODD-FRANK.     DODD-FRANK, AS WELL AS REGULATIONS PROMULGATED THEREUNDER, COULD     HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\\x92S     BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION BY, FOR     EXAMPLE, REQUIRING THE COMPANY TO CHANGE ITS BUSINESS PRACTICES,     REQUIRING THE COMPANY TO COMPLY WITH MORE STRINGENT CAPITAL,     LIQUIDITY AND LEVERAGE RATIO REQUIREMENTS, LIMITING THE     COMPANY\\x92S ABILITY TO PURSUE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES,     IMPOSING ADDITIONAL COSTS ON THE COMPANY (INCLUDING INCREASED     COMPLIANCE COSTS AND INCREASED COSTS OF FUNDING RAISED THROUGH     THE ISSUANCE OF ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES), LIMITING THE FEES THE     COMPANY CAN CHARGE FOR SERVICES AND IMPACTING THE VALUE OF THE     COMPANY\\x92S ASSETS. A DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF     DODD-FRANK AND OTHER LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS IS     CONTAINED IN \\x93SUPERVISION AND REGULATION\\x94 ABOVE.         DODD-FRANK WILL RESULT IN INCREASED SCRUTINY AND OVERSIGHT OF     CONSUMER FINANCIAL SERVICES AND PRODUCTS, PRIMARILY THROUGH THE     ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU WITHIN     THE FEDERAL RESERVE. THE BUREAU WILL HAVE BROAD RULEMAKING AND     ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY OVER PROVIDERS OF CREDIT, SAVINGS AND     PAYMENT SERVICES AND PRODUCTS AND AUTHORITY TO PREVENT     \\x93UNFAIR, DECEPTIVE OR ABUSIVE\\x94 PRACTICES. THE BUREAU     WILL WRITE REGULATIONS UNDER FEDERAL CONSUMER FINANCIAL     PROTECTION LAWS, AND ENFORCE THOSE LAWS AGAINST AND EXAMINE     LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS LIKE US, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB     FOR COMPLIANCE. THE BUREAU WILL COLLECT FINES AND PROVIDE     CONSUMER RESTITUTION IN THE EVENT OF VIOLATIONS, ENGAGE IN     CONSUMER FINANCIAL EDUCATION, TRACK CONSUMER COMPLAINTS, REQUEST     DATA AND PROMOTE THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCIAL SERVICES TO     UNDERSERVED CONSUMERS AND COMMUNITIES. DEPENDING ON HOW THE     BUREAU FUNCTIONS AND ITS AREAS OF FOCUS, IT COULD HAVE A     MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESSES. IN ADDITION TO     INCREASING OUR COMPLIANCE COSTS AND POTENTIALLY DELAYING OUR     ABILITY TO RESPOND TO MARKETPLACE CHANGES, THIS COULD RESULT IN     REQUIREMENTS TO ALTER OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT WOULD MAKE     OUR PRODUCTS LESS ATTRACTIVE TO CONSUMERS AND IMPAIR OUR ABILITY     TO OFFER THEM PROFITABLY. THE IMPACT THIS NEW REGULATORY REGIME     WILL HAVE ON THE COMPANY\\x92S BUSINESS IS UNCERTAIN AT THIS     TIME AND WILL DEPEND ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE TIMING OF THE     BUREAU\\x92S ASSUMPTION OF ITS AUTHORITY FROM OTHER     GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR BY     JULY 21, 2011.         UNDER DODD-FRANK, THE FEDERAL RESERVE IS AUTHORIZED TO REGULATE     INTERCHANGE FEES CHARGED BY PAYMENT CARD ISSUERS FOR     TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH A PERSON USES A DEBIT OR GENERAL-USE     PREPAID CARD, AND TO ENFORCE A NEW STATUTORY REQUIREMENT THAT     SUCH FEES BE REASONABLE AND PROPORTIONAL TO THE ACTUAL COST OF A     TRANSACTION TO THE ISSUER, WITH SPECIFIC ALLOWANCES FOR THE     COSTS OF FRAUD PREVENTION, AS WELL AS TO PROHIBIT EXCLUSIVE     NETWORK ROUTING RESTRICTIONS FOR ELECTRONIC DEBIT TRANSACTIONS.     ADDITIONALLY, DODD-FRANK PROHIBITS PAYMENT CARD NETWORKS FROM     RESTRICTING MERCHANTS FROM OFFERING DISCOUNTS OR INCENTIVES TO     ENCOURAGE CUSTOMERS TO PAY WITH PARTICULAR FORMS OF PAYMENT SUCH     AS CASH, CHECK, CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD, PROVIDED THAT SUCH OFFERS     DO NOT DISCRIMINATE ON THE BASIS OF THE NETWORK OR ISSUER.     FURTHER, TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW OR APPLICABLE     STATE LAW, THE DISCOUNT OR INCENTIVE MUST BE OFFERED TO ALL     PROSPECTIVE BUYERS AND MUST BE CLEARLY AND CONSPICUOUSLY     DISCLOSED. DODD-FRANK ALSO PERMITS U.S. MERCHANTS TO     ESTABLISH MINIMUM PURCHASE AMOUNTS OF NO MORE THAN $10 FOR     CREDIT CARD PURCHASES, PROVIDED THAT THE MERCHANTS DO NOT     DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN NETWORKS OR ISSUERS. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT     AGENCIES AND INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING ALSO ARE PERMITTED     TO ESTABLISH MAXIMUM AMOUNTS FOR CREDIT CARD PURCHASES PROVIDED     THEY DO NOT DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN NETWORKS OR ISSUERS. FOR MORE     INFORMATION ON THIS ASPECT OF DODD-FRANK AND ITS POTENTIAL     IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, PLEASE SEE \\x93RISK FACTORS-BANKS,     CARD ISSUERS AND CARD NETWORK OPERATORS GENERALLY ARE THE     SUBJECT OF INCREASING GLOBAL REGULATORY           77    TABLE OF CONTENTS    FOCUS, WHICH MAY IMPOSE COSTLY NEW COMPLIANCE BURDENS ON OUR     COMPANY AND LEAD TO DECREASED TRANSACTION VOLUMES AND REVENUES     THROUGH OUR NETWORK.\\x94         DODD-FRANK MANDATES THE FEDERAL RESERVE TO ESTABLISH HEIGHTENED     CAPITAL, LEVERAGE AND LIQUIDITY STANDARDS, RISK MANAGEMENT     REQUIREMENTS, CONCENTRATION LIMITS ON CREDIT EXPOSURES,     \\x93LIVING WILLS\\x94 AND STRESS TESTS FOR, AMONG OTHERS,     BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT HAVE GREATER THAN $50 BILLION     IN TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS, SUCH AS THE COMPANY. IN ADDITION,     MOST INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY SWAPS WILL BE REQUIRED TO BE     EXCHANGE-TRADED WHICH MAY INCREASE COLLATERAL POSTING     REQUIREMENTS FOR THE COMPANY.         PURSUANT TO DODD-FRANK, THE RESPONSIBILITY AND AUTHORITY OF THE     OTS TO SUPERVISE FEDERAL SAVINGS ASSOCIATIONS, INCLUDING AEBFSB,     WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO THE OCC ON JULY 21, 2011 (UNLESS     EXTENDED FOR UP TO SIX MONTHS). AEBFSB WILL NEED TO DEVELOP A     RELATIONSHIP WITH ITS NEW REGULATOR, AND THERE COULD BE     ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ALIGNING     AEBFSB\\x92S CURRENT COMPLIANCE STRUCTURE WITH THE OCC\\x92S     EXPECTATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, THE TRANSFER OF RESPONSIBILITY FROM     THE OTS TO THE OCC COULD RESULT IN NEW REGULATORY STANDARDS AS     IT IS, AT THIS TIME, UNCLEAR WHETHER THE OCC WILL ADOPT OR     MODIFY OTS REGULATIONS, ORDERS OR POLICIES, INCLUDING     INTERPRETATIONS OR APPLICATIONS. ANY SHIFTS IN CURRENT     REGULATORY POSITIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF     OPERATION.         MANY PROVISIONS OF DODD-FRANK, INCLUDING NUMEROUS PROVISIONS NOT     DESCRIBED ABOVE, REQUIRE THE ADOPTION OF RULES TO IMPLEMENT. IN     ADDITION, DODD-FRANK MANDATES MULTIPLE STUDIES, WHICH COULD     RESULT IN ADDITIONAL LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY ACTION.     THEREFORE, THE ULTIMATE CONSEQUENCES OF DODD-FRANK AND ITS     IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS ON THE COMPANY\\x92S BUSINESS, RESULTS     OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION REMAIN UNCERTAIN.     THE     CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTABILITY RESPONSIBILITY AND DISCLOSURE ACT OF     2009 WILL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES AND COULD     HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF     OPERATIONS.         THE CARD ACT REQUIRED THE COMPANY TO MAKE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES TO     MANY OF OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES, INCLUDING MARKETING,     UNDERWRITING, PRICING AND BILLING. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE CARD     ACT PROHIBITS AN ISSUER FROM INCREASING THE APR ON OUTSTANDING     BALANCES (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS), REQUIRES ADDITIONAL ACCOUNT     DISCLOSURES, PROVIDES CONSUMERS WITH THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF     SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO ACCOUNT TERMS, AND RESTRICTS PENALTY FEES     AND CHARGES THAT MAY BE IMPOSED BY AN ISSUER. MOST OF THE     REQUIREMENTS OF THE CARD ACT BECAME EFFECTIVE IN FEBRUARY 2010.     ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS TO REGULATION Z REVISING THE OPEN-END     CREDIT DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS BECAME EFFECTIVE ON JULY 1,     2010.         SINCE AUGUST 22, 2010, THE CARD ACT, AMONG OTHER THINGS,     REQUIRES THAT PENALTY FEES BE REASONABLE AND PROPORTIONAL. ALSO,     SINCE AUGUST 22, 2010, THE CARD ACT REQUIRES ISSUERS TO     PERIODICALLY REEVALUATE APR INCREASES TO DETERMINE IF A DECREASE     IS APPROPRIATE. THE FIRST OF THESE REEVALUATIONS MUST BE     COMPLETED IN FEBRUARY 2011. THE OBLIGATION TO PERIODICALLY     REEVALUATE APR INCREASES IS ONGOING, AND IT IS UNCERTAIN HOW     THESE PROVISIONS WILL BE INTERPRETED OR AMENDED BY THE NEW     CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU. THEREFORE, WHILE THE     ULTIMATE IMPACT OF THIS REQUIREMENT IS UNCERTAIN AT THIS TIME,     IT COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.         WHILE THE COMPANY HAS MADE CERTAIN CHANGES TO ITS PRODUCT TERMS     AND PRACTICES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF THE     CHANGES REQUIRED BY THE CARD ACT, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT IT     WILL BE SUCCESSFUL. THE LONG-TERM IMPACT OF THE CARD ACT ON THE     COMPANY\\x92S BUSINESS PRACTICES AND REVENUES WILL DEPEND UPON     A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING ITS ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY     IMPLEMENT ITS BUSINESS STRATEGIES, CONSUMER BEHAVIOR AND THE     ACTIONS OF THE COMPANY\\x92S COMPETITORS, WHICH ARE DIFFICULT     TO PREDICT AT THIS TIME. IN THE EVENT THE ACTIONS UNDERTAKEN BY     THE COMPANY TO DATE TO OFFSET THE IMPACT OF THE NEW LEGISLATION     AND REGULATIONS ARE NOT ULTIMATELY EFFECTIVE, THEY COULD HAVE A     MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY\\x92S RESULTS OF     OPERATIONS, INCLUDING ITS REVENUE AND NET INCOME.         78    TABLE OF CONTENTS    OUR     BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT AND EXTENSIVE GOVERNMENT     REGULATION AND SUPERVISION WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR     RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.         ON NOVEMBER 14, 2008, AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY AND TRS EACH     BECAME BANK HOLDING COMPANIES UNDER THE BHC ACT AND ELECTED TO     BE TREATED AS FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES UNDER THE BHC ACT. AS     A RESULT OF BECOMING A BANK HOLDING COMPANY, WE ARE SUBJECT TO     REGULATION BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT     LIMITATION, CONSOLIDATED CAPITAL REGULATION AT THE HOLDING     COMPANY LEVEL, MAINTENANCE OF CERTAIN CAPITAL AND MANAGEMENT     STANDARDS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR TWO U.S. DEPOSITORY     INSTITUTIONS AND RESTRICTIONS ON OUR NON-BANKING ACTIVITIES     UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVE\\x92S REGULATIONS.         IF WE FAIL TO SATISFY REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO BANK     HOLDING COMPANIES, OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF     OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.         WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND     SUPERVISION IN JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD, BOTH AS A     PARTICIPANT IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AND OTHERWISE.     BANKING REGULATIONS ARE PRIMARILY INTENDED TO PROTECT     DEPOSITORS\\x92 FUNDS, FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUNDS AND THE     BANKING SYSTEM AS A WHOLE, AND NOT FOR THE PROTECTION OF OUR     SHAREHOLDERS OR CREDITORS. AMONG OTHER THINGS, AS A RESULT OF     REGULATORS ENFORCING EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS, WE COULD BE     FINED, PROHIBITED FROM ENGAGING IN SOME OF OUR BUSINESS     ACTIVITIES, SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS OR CONDITIONS ON OUR BUSINESS     ACTIVITIES OR SUBJECTED TO NEW OR SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER TAXES OR     OTHER GOVERNMENTAL CHARGES IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONDUCT OF OUR     BUSINESS OR WITH RESPECT TO OUR EMPLOYEES. THERE IS ALSO THE     RISK THAT NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR CHANGES IN ENFORCEMENT OF     EXISTING LAWS OR REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO OUR BUSINESSES MAY BE     IMPOSED WHICH COULD IMPACT THE PROFITABILITY OF THE     COMPANY\\x92S BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PURSUE     BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO CHANGE CERTAIN OF     ITS BUSINESS PRACTICES OR ALTER ITS RELATIONSHIPS WITH     CUSTOMERS, AFFECT RETENTION OF KEY COMPANY PERSONNEL, OR EXPOSE     THE COMPANY TO ADDITIONAL COSTS (INCLUDING INCREASED COMPLIANCE     COSTS). SUCH CHANGES ALSO MAY REQUIRE US TO INVEST SIGNIFICANT     MANAGEMENT ATTENTION AND RESOURCES TO MAKE ANY NECESSARY CHANGES     AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND     FINANCIAL CONDITION.         PLEASE SEE \\x93SUPERVISION AND REGULATION\\x94 BEGINNING ON     PAGE 38 FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE REGULATION TO WHICH     WE ARE SUBJECT.     WE ARE     SUBJECT TO CAPITAL ADEQUACY GUIDELINES AND, IF WE FAIL TO MEET     THESE GUIDELINES, OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION WOULD BE ADVERSELY     AFFECTED.         UNDER REGULATORY CAPITAL ADEQUACY GUIDELINES AND OTHER     REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, THE COMPANY, TRS AND OUR SUBSIDIARY     BANKS, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, MUST MEET GUIDELINES FOR     CAPITAL ADEQUACY AND LEVERAGE RATIOS THAT INCLUDE QUANTITATIVE     MEASURES OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND CERTAIN OFF-BALANCE SHEET     ITEMS, SUBJECT TO QUALITATIVE JUDGMENTS BY REGULATORS ABOUT     COMPONENTS, RISK WEIGHTINGS AND OTHER FACTORS. AS DISCUSSED     ABOVE UNDER \\x93SUPERVISION AND REGULATION \\x97 CAPITAL     ADEQUACY\\x94, THE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO THE     COMPANY AND TRS AS BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND OUR SUBSIDIARY     DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS ARE IN THE PROCESS OF BEING     SUBSTANTIALLY REVISED, INCLUDING IN CONNECTION WITH OUR     TRANSITION TO BASEL II AND AS A RESULT OF BASEL III     AND THE REQUIREMENTS OF DODD-FRANK. IF THE COMPANY, TRS OR OUR     SUBSIDIARY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS FAIL TO MEET CURRENT OR     FUTURE MINIMUM CAPITAL, LEVERAGE OR OTHER FINANCIAL     REQUIREMENTS, THEIR RESPECTIVE FINANCIAL CONDITIONS WOULD BE     MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IN LIGHT OF RECENT MARKET EVENTS,     DODD-FRANK AND BASEL III, THE COMPANY, TRS AND OUR SUBSIDIARY     DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS WILL BE REQUIRED TO SATISFY ADDITIONAL,     MORE STRINGENT CAPITAL ADEQUACY STANDARDS THAN IN THE PAST. WE     CANNOT FULLY PREDICT THE FINAL FORM OF, OR THE EFFECTS OF, THESE     REGULATIONS. FAILURE BY ANY OF THE COMPANY, TRS OR A SUBSIDIARY     DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION TO MAINTAIN ITS RESPECTIVE STATUS AS     \\x93WELL CAPITALIZED\\x94 AND \\x93WELL MANAGED,\\x94 IF     UNREMEDIED OVER A PERIOD OF TIME, WOULD CAUSE US TO LOSE OUR     STATUS AS A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY AND COULD COMPROMISE OUR     COMPETITIVE POSITION. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON CAPITAL ADEQUACY     REQUIREMENTS, PLEASE SEE \\x93SUPERVISION AND     REGULATION \\x97 CAPITAL ADEQUACY\\x94 ABOVE.         79    TABLE OF CONTENTS    WE ARE     SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS THAT LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS     AND REPURCHASE OUR CAPITAL STOCK.         WE ARE LIMITED IN OUR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS BY OUR REGULATORS     WHO COULD PROHIBIT A DIVIDEND THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED AN UNSAFE     OR UNSOUND BANKING PRACTICE. FOR EXAMPLE, IT IS THE POLICY OF     THE FEDERAL RESERVE THAT BANK HOLDING COMPANIES SHOULD GENERALLY     PAY DIVIDENDS ON COMMON STOCK ONLY OUT OF EARNINGS, AND ONLY IF     PROSPECTIVE EARNINGS RETENTION IS CONSISTENT WITH THE     ORGANIZATION\\x92S EXPECTED FUTURE NEEDS, ASSET QUALITY, AND     FINANCIAL CONDITION. RECENTLY ISSUED TEMPORARY GUIDANCE FROM THE     FEDERAL RESERVE STATES THAT OUR DIVIDEND POLICIES WILL BE     ASSESSED AGAINST, AMONG OTHER THINGS, OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE     BASEL III CAPITAL RATIO REQUIREMENTS. A COMPANY THAT HAS     NOT ACHIEVED BASEL III CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ON A FULLY     PHASED-IN BASIS MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY INCREASING DIVIDENDS.         WHILE THE REGULATIONS ULTIMATELY APPLICABLE TO THE COMPANY WILL     BE DETERMINED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES     THAT, HAD REGULATIONS IMPLEMENTING BASEL III BEEN IN PLACE     DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2010, THE COMPANY\\x92S CAPITAL     RATIOS UNDER BASEL III WOULD HAVE EXCEEDED THE MINIMUM     REQUIREMENTS. THIS ESTIMATE COULD CHANGE IN THE FUTURE. WHILE WE     EXPECT TO MEET THE BASEL III CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS,     INCLUSIVE OF THE CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER, AS PHASED IN BY     THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE REGULATIONS ULTIMATELY APPLICABLE TO US     MAY BE SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE BASEL III FINAL     FRAMEWORK AS PUBLISHED IN DECEMBER 2010. MOREOVER, THE FEDERAL     RESERVE WILL CLOSELY SCRUTINIZE ANY DIVIDEND PAYOUT RATIOS     EXCEEDING 30% OF AFTER-TAX NET INCOME.         DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2010, WE REPURCHASED     14 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK THROUGH OUR SHARE     REPURCHASE PROGRAM. ON JANUARY 7, 2011, WE SUBMITTED OUR     COMPREHENSIVE CAPITAL PLAN (\\x93CCP\\x94) TO THE FEDERAL     RESERVE REQUESTING APPROVAL TO PROCEED WITH ADDITIONAL SHARE     REPURCHASES IN 2011. THE CCP INCLUDES AN ANALYSIS OF PERFORMANCE     AND CAPITAL AVAILABILITY UNDER CERTAIN ADVERSE ECONOMIC     ASSUMPTIONS. WE EXPECT A RESPONSE FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE BY     THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER. NO ADDITIONAL SHARES ARE EXPECTED     TO BE REPURCHASED PRIOR TO ITS RESPONSE. WE CANNOT PREDICT     WHETHER THE FEDERAL RESERVE WILL APPROVE ADDITIONAL SHARE     PURCHASES.         FOR MORE INFORMATION ON BANK HOLDING COMPANY DIVIDEND     RESTRICTIONS, PLEASE SEE \\x93SUPERVISION AND     REGULATION \\x97 GENERAL \\x97 DIVIDENDS\\x94 ON     PAGE 46, AS WELL AS \\x93FINANCIAL REVIEW \\x97     SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS\\x94 ON PAGE 41 AND     NOTE 23 ON PAGE 111 OF OUR 2010 ANNUAL REPORT TO     SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH INFORMATION IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY     REFERENCE.     BANKS,     CARD ISSUERS AND CARD NETWORK OPERATORS GENERALLY ARE THE     SUBJECT OF INCREASING GLOBAL REGULATORY FOCUS, WHICH MAY IMPOSE     COSTLY NEW COMPLIANCE BURDENS ON OUR COMPANY AND LEAD TO     DECREASED TRANSACTION VOLUMES AND REVENUES THROUGH OUR     NETWORK.         WE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS THAT AFFECT BANKS AND THE PAYMENTS     INDUSTRY IN THE UNITED STATES AND MANY OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH     OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS ARE USED AND WHERE WE CONDUCT     BANKING AND CARD ACTIVITIES. IN PARTICULAR, WE ARE SUBJECT TO     NUMEROUS REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE     UNITED STATES AND ABROAD. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS AS     A PROVIDER OF SERVICES TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. REGULATION OF     THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN RECENT     YEARS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE     BANK SECRECY ACT AS AMENDED BY THE PATRIOT ACT, WITH REGARD TO     MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING PROGRAMS. INCREASED     REGULATORY FOCUS IN THIS AREA COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL     OBLIGATIONS OR RESTRICTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE TYPES OF     PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE MAY OFFER TO CONSUMERS, THE COUNTRIES     IN WHICH OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS MAY BE USED, AND THE TYPES     OF CARDHOLDERS AND MERCHANTS WHO CAN OBTAIN OR ACCEPT OUR CHARGE     AND CREDIT CARDS. IN ADDITION, THE MEMBER STATES OF THE EUROPEAN     ECONOMIC AREA HAVE NOW IMPLEMENTED A RELATIVELY NEW EUROPEAN     UNION LEGISLATIVE DIRECTIVE, CALLED THE PAYMENT SERVICES     DIRECTIVE, FOR ELECTRONIC PAYMENT SERVICES, INCLUDING CARDS,     THAT PUTS IN PLACE A COMMON LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR LICENSING AND     SUPERVISION OF PAYMENT SERVICES PROVIDERS, INCLUDING CARD     ISSUERS AND MERCHANT ACQUIRERS, AND FOR THEIR CONDUCT OF     BUSINESS.         VARIOUS REGULATORY AGENCIES AND LEGISLATURES ARE ALSO     CONSIDERING REGULATIONS AND LEGISLATION COVERING IDENTITY THEFT,     ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES, DISCLOSURE RULES, SECURITY, AND     MARKETING THAT WOULD IMPACT US DIRECTLY, IN PART DUE TO     INCREASED SCRUTINY OF OUR UNDERWRITING STANDARDS. THESE NEW     REQUIREMENTS MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO ISSUE CHARGE AND CREDIT     CARDS OR PARTNER WITH OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, WHICH COULD     DECREASE          80    TABLE OF CONTENTS        OUR TRANSACTION VOLUMES. IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, NEW REGULATIONS     AND LEGISLATION COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF LIMITING OUR ABILITY TO     OFFER NEW TYPES OF CHARGE OR CREDIT CARDS OR RESTRICTING OUR     ABILITY TO OFFER EXISTING CARDS, SUCH AS STORED VALUE CARDS,     WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY REDUCE OUR REVENUES AND     REVENUE GROWTH.         IN RECENT YEARS, REGULATORS IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE     UNITED STATES HAVE FOCUSED ON THE FEES INVOLVED IN THE OPERATION     OF CARD NETWORKS, INCLUDING INTERCHANGE FEES PAID TO CARD     ISSUERS AND THE FEES MERCHANTS ARE CHARGED TO ACCEPT CARDS.     REGULATORS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, CANADA, NEW ZEALAND, POLAND,     ITALY, SWITZERLAND, HUNGARY, THE EUROPEAN UNION, AUSTRALIA,     BRAZIL, MEXICO AND VENEZUELA, AMONG OTHERS, HAVE CONDUCTED     INVESTIGATIONS THAT ARE EITHER ONGOING, CONCLUDED OR ON APPEAL.         THE INTERCHANGE FEE, WHICH IS THE COLLECTIVELY SET FEE PAID BY     THE BANKCARD MERCHANT ACQUIRER TO THE CARD ISSUING BANK IN     \\x93FOUR PARTY\\x94 PAYMENT NETWORKS, LIKE VISA AND     MASTERCARD, IS GENERALLY THE LARGEST COMPONENT OF THE MERCHANT     SERVICE CHARGE CHARGED TO MERCHANTS FOR BANKCARD DEBIT AND     CREDIT CARD ACCEPTANCE IN THESE SYSTEMS. BY CONTRAST, THE     AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK DOES NOT HAVE INTERCHANGE FEES.     ALTHOUGH THE REGULATORS\\x92 FOCUS HAS PRIMARILY BEEN ON VISA     AND MASTERCARD AS THE DOMINANT CARD NETWORKS AND ON THEIR     OPERATIONS ON A MULTILATERAL BASIS, ANTITRUST ACTIONS AND     GOVERNMENT REGULATION RELATING TO MERCHANT PRICING COULD     ULTIMATELY AFFECT ALL NETWORKS. LOWER INTERCHANGE     AND/OR     MERCHANT DISCOUNT REVENUE MAY LEAD CARD ISSUERS TO LOOK FOR     OTHER SOURCES OF REVENUE SUCH AS HIGHER ANNUAL CARD FEES OR     INTEREST CHARGES, AS WELL AS TO REDUCE COSTS BY SCALING BACK OR     ELIMINATING REWARDS PROGRAMS.         IN THE UNITED STATES, CONGRESS CONTINUED TO FOCUS ON THE     INTERCHANGE ISSUE DURING 2010. CONGRESS PASSED DODD-FRANK, WHICH     THE PRESIDENT SIGNED INTO LAW IN JULY 2010. DODD-FRANK GIVES THE     FEDERAL RESERVE THE AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH RULES REGARDING     INTERCHANGE FEES CHARGED BY PAYMENT CARD ISSUERS FOR     TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH A PERSON USES A DEBIT OR GENERAL-USE     PREPAID CARD, AND TO ENFORCE A NEW STATUTORY REQUIREMENT THAT     SUCH FEES BE REASONABLE AND PROPORTIONAL TO THE ACTUAL COST OF A     TRANSACTION TO THE ISSUER, WITH SPECIFIC ALLOWANCES FOR THE     COSTS OF FRAUD PREVENTION, AS WELL AS TO PROHIBIT EXCLUSIVE     NETWORK ROUTING RESTRICTIONS FOR ELECTRONIC DEBIT TRANSACTIONS.     AMERICAN EXPRESS DOES NOT OFFER A DEBIT CARD LINKED TO A DEPOSIT     ACCOUNT, BUT DOES ISSUE VARIOUS TYPES OF PREPAID CARDS.     RELOADABLE GENERAL-USE PREPAID CARDS, BUT NOT THOSE MARKETED OR     LABELED AS GIFT CARDS OR GIFT CERTIFICATES, ARE EXEMPT FROM THE     INTERCHANGE FEE LIMITATIONS. IN CONTRAST TO THE INTERCHANGE FEE     LIMITATIONS, ALL PREPAID CARDS WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE EXCLUSIVE     NETWORK ROUTING RESTRICTIONS FOR ELECTRONIC DEBIT TRANSACTIONS.     IN DECEMBER 2010, THE FEDERAL RESERVE ISSUED A NOTICE OF     PROPOSED RULEMAKING REQUESTING COMMENTS TO IMPLEMENT THE     INTERCHANGE FEE LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIVE NETWORK ROUTING     RESTRICTIONS. THE FEDERAL RESERVE MUST ISSUE FINAL RULES ON THE     EXCLUSIVE NETWORK ROUTING RESTRICTIONS BY JULY 21, 2011.     THE STATUTE DOES NOT SPECIFY WHEN THOSE RULES MUST TAKE EFFECT.     IT IS DIFFICULT TO ASSESS AT THIS TIME THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE     FINAL REGULATIONS, ONCE ISSUED, COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR     REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY.         ADDITIONALLY, DODD-FRANK PROHIBITS PAYMENT CARD NETWORKS FROM     RESTRICTING MERCHANTS FROM OFFERING DISCOUNTS OR INCENTIVES TO     ENCOURAGE CUSTOMERS TO PAY WITH PARTICULAR FORMS OF PAYMENT SUCH     AS CASH, CHECK, CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD, PROVIDED THAT SUCH OFFERS     DO NOT DISCRIMINATE ON THE BASIS OF THE NETWORK OR ISSUER.     FURTHER, TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW OR APPLICABLE     STATE LAW, THE DISCOUNT OR INCENTIVE MUST BE OFFERED TO ALL     PROSPECTIVE BUYERS AND MUST BE CLEARLY AND CONSPICUOUSLY     DISCLOSED. DODD-FRANK ALSO PERMITS U.S. MERCHANTS TO     ESTABLISH MINIMUM PURCHASE AMOUNTS OF NO MORE THAN $10 FOR     CREDIT CARD PURCHASES, PROVIDED THAT THE MERCHANTS DO NOT     DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN NETWORKS OR ISSUERS. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT     AGENCIES AND INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING ARE ALSO PERMITTED     TO ESTABLISH MAXIMUM AMOUNTS FOR CREDIT CARD PURCHASES PROVIDED     THEY DO NOT DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN NETWORKS OR ISSUERS. AS A     RESULT OF THESE NEW LAWS, CUSTOMERS MAY BE INCENTIVIZED BY     MERCHANTS TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE USE OF CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD     PRODUCTS TO OTHER FORMS OF PAYMENT, SUCH AS DEBIT, WHICH COULD     ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY.         DURING THE LAST FOUR YEARS, A NUMBER OF BILLS WERE PROPOSED IN     INDIVIDUAL STATE LEGISLATURES SEEKING TO IMPOSE CAPS ON CREDIT     CARD INTERCHANGE FEES OR TO PROHIBIT CREDIT CARD COMPANIES FROM     CHARGING A MERCHANT DISCOUNT ON THE SALES TAX PORTION OF CREDIT     CARD PURCHASES. OTHER PROPOSALS WERE AIMED AT INCREASING THE     TRANSPARENCY OF CARD NETWORK RULES FOR MERCHANTS. IN ADDITION, A     NUMBER OF BILLS WERE PROPOSED TO ESTABLISH MERCHANT LIABILITY     FOR THE COSTS OF A DATA SECURITY BREACH OF A MERCHANT\\x92S     SYSTEM OR REQUIRE MERCHANTS TO ADOPT TECHNICAL SAFEGUARDS TO     PROTECT SENSITIVE CARDHOLDER PAYMENT INFORMATION. IN 2010,     VERMONT ENACTED LEGISLATION THAT PERMITS MERCHANTS TO SET A     MINIMUM DOLLAR VALUE OF NO MORE THAN $10 FOR ACCEPTANCE OF ANY     FORM OF          81    TABLE OF CONTENTS        PAYMENT; PERMITS MERCHANTS TO PROVIDE DISCOUNTS OR OTHER     BENEFITS BASED ON THE FORM OF PAYMENT (I.E., CARD, CASH, CHECK,     DEBIT CARD, STORED-VALUE CARD, CHARGE CARD OR CREDIT CARD); AND     PERMITS MERCHANTS TO ACCEPT THE CARDS OF A PAYMENT SYSTEM AT ONE     OR MORE OF ITS LOCATIONS BUT NOT AT OTHERS. THIS LEGISLATION MAY     SERVE AS A MODEL FOR OTHER STATES. IN THE EVENT THAT ADDITIONAL     LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY ACTIVITY TO LIMIT INTERCHANGE OR     MERCHANT FEES CONTINUES OR INCREASES, OR STATE DATA SECURITY     LEGISLATION IS ADOPTED, OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY COULD BE     ADVERSELY AFFECTED.         INCREASED REGULATORY FOCUS ON OUR COMPANY, SUCH AS IN CONNECTION     WITH THE MATTERS DISCUSSED ABOVE, MAY INCREASE OUR COMPLIANCE     COSTS OR RESULT IN A REDUCTION OF TRANSACTIONS PROCESSED ON OUR     NETWORKS OR MERCHANT DISCOUNT REVENUES FROM SUCH TRANSACTIONS,     WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF     OPERATIONS.     IF WE     ARE NOT ABLE TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND INVEST     SUCCESSFULLY IN, AND COMPETE AT THE LEADING EDGE OF,     TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS ACROSS ALL OUR BUSINESSES, OUR     REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY COULD BE NEGATIVELY     AFFECTED.         OUR INDUSTRY IS SUBJECT TO RAPID AND SIGNIFICANT TECHNOLOGICAL     CHANGES. IN ORDER TO COMPETE IN OUR INDUSTRY, WE NEED TO     CONTINUE TO INVEST IN BUSINESS PROCESS AND TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES     ACROSS ALL AREAS OF OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING IN TRANSACTION     PROCESSING, DATA MANAGEMENT, CUSTOMER INTERACTIONS AND     COMMUNICATIONS, TRAVEL RESERVATIONS SYSTEMS, PREPAID PRODUCTS,     ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MECHANISMS AND RISK MANAGEMENT AND     COMPLIANCE SYSTEMS. WE RELY IN PART ON THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING     SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS, FOR THE     DEVELOPMENT OF AND ACCESS TO NEW TECHNOLOGIES. WE EXPECT THAT     NEW TECHNOLOGIES APPLICABLE TO THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY WILL     CONTINUE TO EMERGE, AND THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES MAY BE SUPERIOR     TO, OR RENDER OBSOLETE, THE TECHNOLOGIES WE CURRENTLY USE IN OUR     CARDS, NETWORKS AND OTHER SERVICES. BECAUSE OF EVOLVING PAYMENTS     TECHNOLOGIES AND THE COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE, WE MAY NOT, AMONG     OTHER THINGS, BE SUCCESSFUL IN INCREASING OR MAINTAINING OUR     SHARE OF ONLINE SPENDING AND ENHANCING OUR CARDMEMBERS\\x92     DIGITAL EXPERIENCE, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR     REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY. OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP, ACQUIRE, OR     ACCESS COMPETITIVE TECHNOLOGIES OR BUSINESS PROCESSES ON     ACCEPTABLE TERMS MAY BE LIMITED BY PATENT RIGHTS THAT THIRD     PARTIES, INCLUDING COMPETITORS AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS, MAY     ASSERT. IN ADDITION, OUR ABILITY TO ADOPT NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT     WE DEVELOP MAY BE INHIBITED BY A NEED FOR INDUSTRY-WIDE     STANDARDS OR BY RESISTANCE FROM CARDMEMBERS OR MERCHANTS TO SUCH     CHANGES.         WE RELY ON A VARIETY OF MEASURES TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL     PROPERTY AND PROPRIETARY INFORMATION, INCLUDING COPYRIGHTS,     TRADEMARKS, PATENTS AND CONTROLS ON ACCESS AND DISTRIBUTION.     THESE MEASURES MAY NOT PREVENT MISAPPROPRIATION OR INFRINGEMENT     OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION AND A     RESULTING LOSS OF COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. IN ADDITION,     COMPETITORS OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES MAY ALLEGE THAT OUR SYSTEMS,     PROCESSES OR TECHNOLOGIES INFRINGE THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY     RIGHTS. GIVEN THE COMPLEX, RAPIDLY CHANGING AND COMPETITIVE     TECHNOLOGICAL AND BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE OPERATE AND     THE POTENTIAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY     RELATED LITIGATION, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT A FUTURE ASSERTION     OF AN INFRINGEMENT CLAIM AGAINST US WILL NOT CAUSE US TO LOSE     SIGNIFICANT REVENUES, INCUR SIGNIFICANT LICENSE, ROYALTY OR     TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES, OR PAY SIGNIFICANT MONETARY     DAMAGES.     REGULATION     IN THE AREAS OF PRIVACY AND DATA SECURITY COULD INCREASE OUR     COSTS AND DECREASE THE NUMBER OF CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS     ISSUED.         WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS REGULATIONS RELATED TO PRIVACY AND     DATA SECURITY/BREACH, AND WE COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY     THESE REGULATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE UNITED STATES, WE ARE     SUBJECT TO THE SAFEGUARDS GUIDELINES UNDER THE     GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT. THE SAFEGUARDS GUIDELINES REQUIRE THAT     EACH FINANCIAL INSTITUTION DEVELOP, IMPLEMENT AND MAINTAIN A     WRITTEN, COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION SECURITY PROGRAM CONTAINING     SAFEGUARDS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE TO THE FINANCIAL     INSTITUTION\\x92S SIZE AND COMPLEXITY, THE NATURE AND SCOPE OF     THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION\\x92S ACTIVITIES AND THE SENSITIVITY     OF ANY CUSTOMER INFORMATION AT ISSUE. BROAD-RANGING DATA     SECURITY LAWS THAT AFFECT OUR BUSINESS HAVE ALSO BEEN ADOPTED BY     VARIOUS STATES, SUCH AS MASSACHUSETTS AND NEVADA.         COMPLIANCE WITH THESE LAWS REGARDING THE PROTECTION OF CUSTOMER     AND EMPLOYEE DATA COULD RESULT IN HIGHER COMPLIANCE AND     TECHNOLOGY COSTS FOR THE COMPANY, AS WELL AS POTENTIALLY     SIGNIFICANT FINES AND PENALTIES          82    TABLE OF CONTENTS        FOR NON-COMPLIANCE. MANY FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE     OPERATE ARE ALSO EXPANDING THE SCOPE OF THEIR DATA SECURITY     REQUIREMENTS AND STANDARDS, AS WELL AS INCREASING ENFORCEMENT     ACTIVITY IN THIS AREA. IN 1995, THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND     COUNCIL PASSED EUROPEAN DIRECTIVE 95/46/EC ON THE PROTECTION OF     INDIVIDUALS WITH REGARD TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA AND     ON THE FREE MOVEMENT OF SUCH DATA (COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE     DATA PROTECTION DIRECTIVE), WHICH OBLIGATES THE CONTROLLER OF AN     INDIVIDUAL\\x92S PERSONAL DATA TO TAKE THE NECESSARY TECHNICAL     AND ORGANIZATIONAL MEASURES TO PROTECT PERSONAL DATA. THE DATA     PROTECTION DIRECTIVE HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED THROUGH LOCAL LAWS     REGULATING DATA PROTECTION IN EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES. AS     THESE LAWS ARE INTERPRETED THROUGHOUT THE EUROPEAN UNION WHERE     WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT COMMERCIAL PRESENCE, COMPLIANCE COSTS ARE     INCREASING, PARTICULARLY IN THE CONTEXT OF ENSURING THAT     ADEQUATE DATA SECURITY PROTECTIONS AND DATA TRANSFER MECHANISMS     ARE IN PLACE. IN JULY 2010, WE SUBMITTED FOR REVIEW BY RELEVANT     EUROPEAN DATA PROTECTION AUTHORITIES OUR DRAFT BINDING CORPORATE     RULES FOR PROCESSING OF DATA WITHIN THE AMERICAN EXPRESS GROUP     WHICH, ONCE APPROVED, WILL ENABLE A MORE EFFICIENT BASIS ON     WHICH TO TRANSFER DATA WITHIN OUR GROUP.         IN ADDITION TO THE FOREGOING ENHANCED DATA SECURITY     REQUIREMENTS, VARIOUS FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORY AGENCIES, AND     AS MANY AS 46 STATES, THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, PUERTO RICO     AND THE VIRGIN ISLANDS, HAVE ENACTED DATA BREACH REGULATIONS AND     LAWS REQUIRING VARYING LEVELS OF CONSUMER NOTIFICATION IN THE     EVENT OF A SECURITY BREACH. DATA BREACH LAWS ARE ALSO BECOMING     MORE PREVALENT IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD WHERE WE OPERATE,     INCLUDING JAPAN, MEXICO AND GERMANY. IN MANY COUNTRIES THAT HAVE     YET TO IMPOSE AUTOMATIC DATA BREACH NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS,     REGULATORS HAVE INCREASINGLY USED THE THREAT OF SIGNIFICANT     SANCTIONS AND PENALTIES BY DATA PROTECTION AUTHORITIES TO     ENCOURAGE VOLUNTARY NOTIFICATION AND DISCOURAGE DATA BREACHES.     MANY OF THESE REGULATIONS ALSO APPLY BROADLY TO     RETAILERS/MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT OUR CARDS; THUS, TO THE EXTENT     THEY EXPERIENCE DATA SECURITY BREACHES, THIS PRESENTS ADDITIONAL     RISKS FOR AMERICAN EXPRESS AND OUR CARDMEMBERS.         IN ADDITION, FEDERAL LEGISLATORS AND REGULATORS ARE INCREASINGLY     PURSUING NEW GUIDELINES, LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT, IF ADOPTED,     COULD FURTHER RESTRICT HOW THE COMPANY COLLECTS, USES, SHARES     AND SECURES CUSTOMER INFORMATION, WHICH COULD IMPACT SOME OF THE     COMPANY\\x92S CURRENT OR PLANNED BUSINESS INITIATIVES. FOR     EXAMPLE, A RECENT FTC REPORT, WHICH APPLIES TO A COMPANY\\x92S     COLLECTION AND USE OF CUSTOMER INFORMATION BOTH ONLINE AND     OFFLINE, WOULD IMPOSE GREATER TRANSPARENCY, USE, DISCLOSURE AND     CONSUMER CHOICE OBLIGATIONS ON THE COMPANY, AND MAY ULTIMATELY     RESULT IN THE CREATION OF AN ONLINE MECHANISM THROUGH WHICH     CONSUMERS COULD OPT OUT OF ALL ONLINE TRACKING FOR ONLINE     BEHAVIORAL ADVERTISING PURPOSES. A COMPANION REPORT BY THE     UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE (\\x93DOC\\x94) WOULD     REQUIRE COMPANIES TO BE MORE TRANSPARENT IN THEIR ONLINE PRIVACY     PRACTICES, AND RECOMMENDS THE CREATION OF A NATIONAL DATA     SECURITY/DATA BREACH STANDARD. BOTH THE FTC AND THE DOC ARE     EXPECTED TO RELEASE FINAL REPORTS BY THE END OF 2011.     ADDITIONALLY, TWO DRAFT PRIVACY BILLS WERE INTRODUCED IN THE     111TH CONGRESS IN THE SUMMER OF 2010, AND A NUMBER OF     FEDERAL LEGISLATORS HAVE EITHER EXPRESSED THEIR SUPPORT FOR     THESE DRAFT BILLS OR HAVE INDICATED THEIR INTENT TO INTRODUCE     NEW BILLS IN THE 112TH CONGRESS. IF ADOPTED, ANY SUCH     PRIVACY BILL COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE     COMPANY\\x92S CURRENT AND PLANNED DATA PRIVACY AND SECURITY     PRACTICES, COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS OF COMPLIANCE AND BUSINESS     OPERATIONS AND COULD REDUCE REVENUES FROM CERTAIN BUSINESS     INITIATIVES.         WE CONTINUE TO SEEK WAYS TO MINIMIZE THESE RISKS AND COSTS     INTERNALLY BY IMPROVING OUR OWN DATA PRIVACY AND SECURITY     POLICIES AND PRACTICES, AND EXTERNALLY THROUGH REGULAR     IMPROVEMENTS TO THE PCI DATA SECURITY STANDARD AND BY PLACING     STRONG CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS ON RETAILERS/MERCHANTS THAT     ACCEPT OUR CARDS, AS WELL AS ON OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS AND     BUSINESS PARTNERS, RELATING TO DATA SECURITY AND DATA BREACH. WE     ALSO HAVE UNDERTAKEN MEASURES TO ASSESS THE LEVEL OF ACCESS TO     CUSTOMER DATA BY EMPLOYEES AND OUR PARTNERS AND SERVICE     PROVIDERS, AND TO ENSURE THAT SUCH ACCESS IS LIMITED TO THE     LEAST PRIVILEGED LEVEL NECESSARY TO PERFORM THEIR JOB OR     FUNCTION FOR THE COMPANY. STILL, INCREASED REGULATION AND     ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY THROUGHOUT THE WORLD IN THE AREAS OF DATA     PRIVACY AND DATA SECURITY/BREACH MAY MATERIALLY INCREASE OUR     COSTS AND MAY DECREASE THE NUMBER OF OUR CARDS THAT WE ISSUE, OR     RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO FULLY EXPLOIT OUR CLOSED-LOOP     CAPABILITY, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR     PROFITABILITY. OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE PRIVACY AND DATA     SECURITY/BREACH LAWS AND REGULATIONS TO WHICH WE ARE SUBJECT     COULD ALSO RESULT IN FINES, SANCTIONS AND DAMAGE TO OUR GLOBAL     REPUTATION AND OUR BRAND.         83    TABLE OF CONTENTS    OUR     SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT, IN PART, UPON OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND     OTHER KEY PERSONNEL, AND THE LOSS OF KEY PERSONNEL COULD     MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.         OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS, IN PART, ON OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND     OTHER KEY PERSONNEL. OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM HAS SIGNIFICANT     INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE AND WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO REPLACE. OUR     SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM IS RELATIVELY SMALL AND WE BELIEVE WE ARE     IN A CRITICAL PERIOD OF COMPETITION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES     AND PAYMENTS INDUSTRY. THE MARKET FOR QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS IS     HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN     QUALIFIED PERSONNEL OR CANDIDATES TO REPLACE OR SUCCEED MEMBERS     OF OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM OR OTHER KEY PERSONNEL. AS FURTHER     DESCRIBED IN \\x93SUPERVISION AND REGULATION \\x97     COMPENSATION PRACTICES\\x94 ON PAGES 52-53, OUR     COMPENSATION PRACTICES ARE SUBJECT TO REVIEW AND OVERSIGHT BY     THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND THE COMPENSATION PRACTICES OF OUR     DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO REVIEW AND     OVERSIGHT BY THE FDIC AND THE OTS (AND BEGINNING IN JULY 2011,     THE OCC). AS A LARGE FINANCIAL AND BANKING INSTITUTION, WE MAY     BE SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS ON COMPENSATION PRACTICES, WHICH MAY     OR MAY NOT AFFECT OUR COMPETITORS, BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE     FDIC OR OTHER REGULATORS WORLDWIDE. THESE LIMITATIONS, INCLUDING     LIMITATIONS ON ANY INCENTIVE COMPENSATION POLICIES PURSUANT TO     DODD-FRANK, COULD FURTHER AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND     RETAIN OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND OTHER KEY PERSONNEL. THE LOSS     OF KEY PERSONNEL COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.     LITIGATION     AND REGULATORY ACTIONS COULD SUBJECT US TO SIGNIFICANT FINES,     PENALTIES, JUDGMENTS AND/OR REQUIREMENTS RESULTING IN INCREASED     EXPENSES.         BUSINESSES IN THE CREDIT CARD INDUSTRY HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN     SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT LEGAL ACTIONS, INCLUDING CLASS ACTION     LAWSUITS AND PATENT CLAIMS. MANY OF THESE ACTIONS HAVE INCLUDED     CLAIMS FOR SUBSTANTIAL COMPENSATORY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES. IN     ADDITION, WE MAY BE INVOLVED IN VARIOUS ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS     BROUGHT BY GOVERNMENTAL REGULATORY AGENCIES IN THE EVENT OF     NONCOMPLIANCE WITH LAWS OR REGULATIONS, WHICH COULD SUBJECT US     TO SIGNIFICANT FINES, PENALTIES OR OTHER REQUIREMENTS RESULTING     IN INCREASED EXPENSES AND DAMAGE TO OUR GLOBAL REPUTATION AND     OUR BRAND.     BUSINESS     RISKS     OUR     OPERATING RESULTS MAY SUFFER BECAUSE OF SUBSTANTIAL AND     INCREASINGLY INTENSE COMPETITION WORLDWIDE IN THE PAYMENTS     INDUSTRY.         THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND INCLUDES, IN     ADDITION TO CHARGE, CREDIT AND DEBIT CARD NETWORKS AND ISSUERS,     CASH, CREDIT AND ACH, AS WELL AS EVOLVING ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT     MECHANISMS, SYSTEMS AND PRODUCTS, SUCH AS AGGREGATORS (E.G.,     PAYPAL), WIRELESS PAYMENT TECHNOLOGIES (INCLUDING USING MOBILE     TELEPHONE NETWORKS TO CARRY OUT TRANSACTIONS), PREPAID SYSTEMS     AND SYSTEMS LINKED TO PAYMENT CARDS, AND BANK TRANSFER MODELS.     WE ARE THE THIRD LARGEST GENERAL-PURPOSE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD     NETWORK BASED ON CHARGE VOLUME, BEHIND VISA AND MASTERCARD,     WHICH WE BELIEVE ARE LARGER THAN WE ARE IN MOST COUNTRIES. AS A     RESULT, OTHER CARD ISSUERS MAY BE ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM THE     STRONG POSITION AND MARKETING AND PRICING POWER OF VISA AND     MASTERCARD.         BECAUSE OF CONTINUING CONSOLIDATIONS AMONG BANKING AND FINANCIAL     SERVICES COMPANIES AND CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO ACQUISITIONS BY     MAJOR CARD ISSUERS, THERE ARE NOW A SMALLER NUMBER OF     SIGNIFICANT ISSUERS. CONTINUING CONSOLIDATION IN THE BANKING     INDUSTRY MAY RESULT IN A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION WITH A STRONG     RELATIONSHIP WITH US BEING ACQUIRED BY AN INSTITUTION THAT HAS A     STRONG RELATIONSHIP WITH A COMPETITOR, RESULTING IN A POTENTIAL     LOSS OF BUSINESS FOR US. THE LARGEST COMPETING ISSUERS HAVE     CONTINUED TO GROW, IN SEVERAL CASES BY ACQUIRING CARD     PORTFOLIOS, AND ALSO BY CROSS-SELLING THROUGH THEIR RETAIL     BRANCH NETWORKS, AND COMPETITION AMONG ALL ISSUERS REMAINS     INTENSE. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO INCREASING PRICING PRESSURE FROM     OUR COMPETITORS.         IN ADDITION, SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS HAVE DEVELOPED, OR MAY     DEVELOP, SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER FINANCIAL AND OTHER RESOURCES     THAN WE HAVE, MAY OFFER A WIDER RANGE OF PROGRAMS AND SERVICES     THAN WE OFFER OR MAY USE MORE EFFECTIVE ADVERTISING AND     MARKETING STRATEGIES TO ACHIEVE BROADER BRAND RECOGNITION OR     MERCHANT ACCEPTANCE THAN WE HAVE. WE MAY NOT CONTINUE TO BE ABLE     TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY AGAINST THESE THREATS. OUR COMPETITORS     MAY ALSO BE MORE EFFICIENT IN INTRODUCING INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS,     PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAN WE ARE. SPENDING ON OUR CARDS COULD     BE IMPACTED BY CONSUMER USAGE OF DEBIT CARDS, AS WE DO NOT     CURRENTLY OFFER A          84    TABLE OF CONTENTS        DEBIT CARD LINKED TO A DEPOSIT ACCOUNT, BUT WE DO ISSUE VARIOUS     TYPES OF PREPAID CARDS. IN FACT, THE PURCHASE VOLUME AND NUMBER     OF TRANSACTIONS MADE WITH DEBIT CARDS IN THE UNITED STATES HAS     GROWN MORE RAPIDLY THAN CREDIT AND CHARGE CARD TRANSACTIONS.         INTERNATIONALLY, COMPETITION REMAINS FIERCE, AND AS A RESULT, WE     MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN ACCELERATING OUR GROWTH OUTSIDE OF THE     UNITED STATES THROUGH PROPRIETARY CONSUMER, SMALL BUSINESS AND     CORPORATE PRODUCTS, GNS PARTNERS AND ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT     VEHICLES.         NEW TECHNOLOGIES, TOGETHER WITH THE PORTABILITY PROVIDED BY     SMARTPHONES AND TABLETS AND EVOLVING CONSUMER BEHAVIOR WITH     SOCIAL NETWORKING, ARE RAPIDLY CHANGING THE WAY PEOPLE INTERACT     WITH EACH OTHER AND TRANSACT BUSINESS ALL AROUND THE WORLD. IN     THIS CONNECTION, TRADITIONAL AND NON-TRADITIONAL COMPETITORS     SUCH AS MOBILE TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES ARE WORKING TO     DELIVER DIGITAL AND MOBILE PAYMENT SERVICES FOR BOTH CONSUMERS     AND MERCHANTS.         IN THE UNITED STATES, ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT VEHICLES THAT SEEK TO     REDIRECT CUSTOMERS TO PAYMENT SYSTEMS BASED ON ACH CONTINUE TO     EMERGE AND GROW, AND EXISTING DEBIT NETWORKS ALSO CONTINUE TO     EXPAND BOTH ON-AND OFF-LINE AND ARE MAKING EFFORTS TO DEVELOP     ONLINE PIN FUNCTIONALITY, WHICH COULD FURTHER REDUCE THE     RELATIVE USE OF CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS ONLINE.         TO THE EXTENT ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MECHANISMS, SYSTEMS AND     PRODUCTS CONTINUE TO SUCCESSFULLY EXPAND IN THE ONLINE PAYMENTS     SPACE, OUR DISCOUNT REVENUES AND OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS     TRANSACTION DATA THROUGH OUR CLOSED-LOOP NETWORK COULD BE     NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. THE COMPANY HAS RECENTLY CREATED AN     ENTERPRISE GROWTH GROUP TO FOCUS ON THIS STRATEGIC CHALLENGE BY     GENERATING ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF REVENUE ON A GLOBAL BASIS,     BOTH ORGANICALLY AND THROUGH ACQUISITIONS, IN AREAS SUCH AS     ONLINE AND MOBILE PAYMENTS AND FEE-BASED SERVICES. WHILE     EXPANDING THE ENTERPRISE GROWTH GROUP IS A TOP PRIORITY FOR THE     COMPANY, MANY OF THE GROWTH INITIATIVES WILL INVOLVE NEW AREAS     FOR THE COMPANY AND WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN EXECUTING OUR     STRATEGY.         REGULATORS HAVE RECENTLY PUT FORWARD VARIOUS PROPOSALS THAT MAY     IMPACT OUR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING PROPOSALS RELATING TO     RESTRICTIONS ON THE TYPE OF ACTIVITIES IN WHICH FINANCIAL     INSTITUTIONS ARE PERMITTED TO ENGAGE AND THE SIZE OF FINANCIAL     INSTITUTIONS, AND PROPOSALS TO IMPOSE TAXES OR FEES ON CERTAIN     FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THESE OR SIMILAR PROPOSALS, WHICH MAY     NOT APPLY TO ALL OF OUR COMPETITORS, COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO     COMPETE EFFECTIVELY.     WE     FACE INCREASINGLY INTENSE COMPETITIVE PRESSURE THAT MAY IMPACT     THE PRICES WE CHARGE MERCHANTS WHO ACCEPT OUR CARDS FOR PAYMENT     FOR GOODS AND SERVICES.         UNLIKE OUR COMPETITORS IN THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY THAT RELY ON     HIGH REVOLVING CREDIT BALANCES TO DRIVE PROFITS, OUR BUSINESS     MODEL IS FOCUSED ON CARDMEMBER SPENDING. DISCOUNT REVENUE, WHICH     REPRESENTS FEES CHARGED TO MERCHANTS WHEN CARDMEMBERS USE THEIR     CARDS TO PURCHASE GOODS AND SERVICES ON OUR NETWORK, IS     PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY BILLED BUSINESS VOLUMES AND IS OUR LARGEST     SINGLE REVENUE SOURCE. IN RECENT YEARS, WE HAVE BEEN UNDER     MARKET PRESSURE TO REDUCE MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATES AND UNDERTAKE     OTHER REPRICING INITIATIVES. IN ADDITION, DIFFERENTIATED PAYMENT     MODELS FROM NON-TRADITIONAL PLAYERS IN THE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENTS     SPACE AND THE REGULATORY AND LITIGATION ENVIRONMENT COULD POSE     CHALLENGES TO OUR TRADITIONAL PAYMENT MODEL AND ADVERSELY IMPACT     OUR AVERAGE DISCOUNT RATE. AS A PRIORITY IN 2011, WE ARE SEEKING     TO DRIVE GREATER VALUE TO OUR MERCHANTS, WHICH IF NOT     SUCCESSFUL, COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR DISCOUNT REVENUE AND     FINANCIAL RESULTS. IF WE CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE A DECLINE IN THE     AVERAGE MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE OR ARE UNABLE TO SUSTAIN MERCHANT     DISCOUNT RATES ON OUR CARDS WITHOUT EXPERIENCING OVERALL VOLUME     GROWTH OR AN INCREASE IN MERCHANT COVERAGE, OUR REVENUES AND     PROFITABILITY COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.     WE MAY     NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN OUR EFFORTS TO PROMOTE CARD USAGE THROUGH     OUR MARKETING, PROMOTION AND REWARDS PROGRAMS OR TO EFFECTIVELY     CONTROL THE COSTS OF SUCH PROGRAMS, BOTH OF WHICH MAY IMPACT OUR     PROFITABILITY.         OUR BUSINESS IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE HIGH LEVEL OF SPENDING BY     OUR CARDMEMBERS. INCREASING CONSUMER AND BUSINESS SPENDING AND     BORROWING ON OUR PAYMENT SERVICES PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY CREDIT     AND CHARGE CARDS AND TRAVELERS CHEQUES AND OTHER PREPAID     PRODUCTS, AND GROWTH IN CARD LENDING BALANCES, DEPEND IN PART ON     OUR          85    TABLE OF CONTENTS        ABILITY TO DEVELOP AND ISSUE NEW OR ENHANCED CARD AND PREPAID     PRODUCTS AND INCREASE REVENUES FROM SUCH PRODUCTS. ONE OF THE     WAYS IN WHICH WE ATTRACT NEW CARDMEMBERS, REDUCE CARDMEMBER     ATTRITION AND SEEK TO CAPTURE A GREATER SHARE OF CUSTOMERS\\x92     TOTAL SPENDING ON CARDS ISSUED ON OUR NETWORK, BOTH IN THE     UNITED STATES AND IN OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, IS THROUGH     OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM, AS WELL AS OTHER CARDMEMBER     BENEFITS. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COST EFFECTIVELY MANAGE AND     EXPAND CARDMEMBER BENEFITS, INCLUDING CONTAINING THE GROWTH OF     MARKETING, PROMOTION AND REWARDS EXPENSES AND CARDMEMBER     SERVICES EXPENSES. IN ADDITION, MANY CREDIT CARD ISSUERS HAVE     INSTITUTED REWARDS AND CO-BRAND PROGRAMS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO     OURS, AND ISSUERS MAY IN THE FUTURE INSTITUTE PROGRAMS THAT ARE     MORE ATTRACTIVE TO CARDMEMBERS THAN OUR PROGRAMS.         DURING THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE HAVE RECEIVED QUARTERLY     PAYMENTS FROM EACH OF VISA AND MASTERCARD UNDER THE AGREEMENTS     THAT WE ENTERED INTO WITH EACH COMPANY TO SETTLE CLAIMS MADE     AGAINST THEM IN SEPARATE ANTITRUST ACTIONS. WE RECOGNIZED     $280 MILLION ($172 MILLION AFTER-TAX) FROM VISA IN     2010 AND 2009, AND $600 MILLION ($372 MILLION     AFTER-TAX) FROM MASTERCARD IN 2010 AND 2009. OUR ABILITY TO     CONTINUE TO INVEST IN MARKETING, PROMOTION AND REWARDS PROGRAMS,     AS WELL AS OUR OVERALL PROFITABILITY, MAY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED     IF WE ARE UNABLE TO REPLACE THE PAYMENTS PROVIDED TO US UNDER     OUR SETTLEMENTS WITH MASTERCARD AND VISA ONCE THE AGGREGATE     SETTLEMENT AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN PAID IN FULL THROUGH THE SECOND AND     FOURTH QUARTERS OF 2011, RESPECTIVELY.     OUR     BRAND AND REPUTATION ARE KEY ASSETS OF OUR COMPANY, AND OUR     BUSINESS MAY BE AFFECTED BY HOW WE ARE PERCEIVED IN THE     MARKETPLACE.         OUR BRAND AND ITS ATTRIBUTES ARE KEY ASSETS OF THE COMPANY. OUR     ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN CONSUMER CARDMEMBERS AND CORPORATE     CLIENTS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON THE EXTERNAL PERCEPTIONS OF OUR     LEVEL OF SERVICE, TRUSTWORTHINESS, BUSINESS PRACTICES AND     FINANCIAL CONDITION. NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS OR PUBLICITY REGARDING     THESE MATTERS COULD DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AMONG EXISTING AND     POTENTIAL CARDMEMBERS AND CORPORATE CLIENTS, WHICH COULD MAKE IT     DIFFICULT FOR US TO ATTRACT NEW CARDMEMBERS AND MAINTAIN     EXISTING ONES. ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS WITH RESPECT TO OUR INDUSTRY     MAY ALSO, BY ASSOCIATION, NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR REPUTATION, OR     RESULT IN GREATER REGULATORY OR LEGISLATIVE SCRUTINY OR     LITIGATION AGAINST US. ALTHOUGH WE MONITOR DEVELOPMENTS FOR     AREAS OF POTENTIAL RISK TO OUR REPUTATION AND BRAND, NEGATIVE     PERCEPTIONS OR PUBLICITY COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT     OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY.     WE MAY     NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN REALIZING THE BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR     ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY.         WE HAVE RECENTLY ACQUIRED A NUMBER OF BUSINESSES, INCLUDING OUR     ACQUISITIONS OF SERVE, ACCERTIFY AND LOYALTY PARTNER, WHICH IS     PENDING. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO EVALUATE AND ENTER INTO     DISCUSSIONS REGARDING A WIDE ARRAY OF POTENTIAL TRANSACTIONS.     THESE TRANSACTIONS COULD BE MATERIAL TO OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION     AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE PROCESS OF INTEGRATING AN     ACQUIRED COMPANY, BUSINESS, OR TECHNOLOGY HAS CREATED, AND WILL     CONTINUE TO CREATE, UNFORESEEN OPERATING DIFFICULTIES AND     EXPENDITURES. THE AREAS WHERE WE FACE RISKS INCLUDE:     IMPLEMENTATION OR REMEDIATION OF CONTROLS, PROCEDURES, AND     POLICIES AT THE ACQUIRED COMPANY; DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENT TIME     AND FOCUS FROM OPERATING OUR BUSINESS TO ACQUISITION INTEGRATION     CHALLENGES; COORDINATION OF PRODUCT, ENGINEERING, AND SALES AND     MARKETING FUNCTIONS; TRANSITION OF OPERATIONS, USERS, AND     CUSTOMERS ONTO OUR EXISTING PLATFORMS; CULTURAL CHALLENGES     ASSOCIATED WITH INTEGRATING EMPLOYEES FROM THE ACQUIRED COMPANY     INTO OUR ORGANIZATION; RETENTION OF EMPLOYEES FROM THE     BUSINESSES WE ACQUIRE; INTEGRATION OF THE ACQUIRED     COMPANY\\x92S ACCOUNTING, MANAGEMENT INFORMATION, HUMAN     RESOURCE, AND OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEMS; LIABILITY FOR     ACTIVITIES OF THE ACQUIRED COMPANY BEFORE THE ACQUISITION,     INCLUDING PATENT AND TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS, VIOLATIONS     OF LAWS, COMMERCIAL DISPUTES, TAX LIABILITIES, AND OTHER KNOWN     AND UNKNOWN LIABILITIES; LITIGATION OR OTHER CLAIMS IN     CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUIRED COMPANY, INCLUDING CLAIMS FROM     TERMINATED EMPLOYEES, CUSTOMERS, FORMER STOCKHOLDERS, OR OTHER     THIRD PARTIES; IN THE CASE OF FOREIGN ACQUISITIONS, THE NEED TO     INTEGRATE OPERATIONS ACROSS DIFFERENT CULTURES AND LANGUAGES AND     TO ADDRESS THE PARTICULAR ECONOMIC, CURRENCY, POLITICAL, AND     REGULATORY RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIFIC COUNTRIES; AND FAILURE     TO SUCCESSFULLY FURTHER DEVELOP THE ACQUIRED TECHNOLOGY.         86    TABLE OF CONTENTS        OUR FAILURE TO ADDRESS THESE RISKS OR OTHER PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED     IN CONNECTION WITH OUR PAST OR FUTURE ACQUISITIONS AND     INVESTMENTS COULD CAUSE US TO FAIL TO REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED     BENEFITS OF SUCH ACQUISITIONS OR INVESTMENTS, INCUR     UNANTICIPATED LIABILITIES, AND HARM OUR BUSINESS GENERALLY.     AN     INCREASE IN ACCOUNT DATA BREACHES AND FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY USING     OUR CARDS COULD LEAD TO REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE TO OUR BRAND AND     COULD REDUCE THE USE AND ACCEPTANCE OF OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT     CARDS.         WE AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES STORE CARDMEMBER ACCOUNT INFORMATION     IN CONNECTION WITH OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS. CRIMINALS ARE     USING INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED METHODS TO CAPTURE VARIOUS     TYPES OF INFORMATION RELATING TO CARDMEMBERS\\x92 ACCOUNTS,     INCLUDING MEMBERSHIP REWARDS ACCOUNTS, TO ENGAGE IN ILLEGAL     ACTIVITIES SUCH AS FRAUD AND IDENTITY THEFT. AS OUTSOURCING AND     SPECIALIZATION BECOME A MORE ACCEPTABLE AND COMMON WAY OF DOING     BUSINESS IN THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY, THERE ARE MORE THIRD PARTIES     INVOLVED IN PROCESSING TRANSACTIONS USING OUR CARDS. IF DATA     BREACHES OR FRAUD LEVELS INVOLVING OUR CARDS WERE TO RISE, IT     COULD LEAD TO REGULATORY INTERVENTION (SUCH AS MANDATORY CARD     REISSUANCE), INCREASED CONCERNS OF CUSTOMERS RELATING TO THE     PRIVACY OF THEIR DATA AND REPUTATIONAL AND FINANCIAL DAMAGE TO     OUR BRAND, WHICH COULD REDUCE THE USE AND ACCEPTANCE OF OUR     CARDS, AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS.     WE     HAVE AGREEMENTS WITH BUSINESS PARTNERS IN A VARIETY OF     INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY, THAT REPRESENT A     SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS. WE ARE EXPOSED TO RISKS     ASSOCIATED WITH THESE INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING BANKRUPTCIES,     RESTRUCTURINGS, CONSOLIDATIONS AND ALLIANCES OF OUR PARTNERS,     AND THE POSSIBLE OBLIGATION TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO OUR     PARTNERS.         IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS WE ENTER INTO DIFFERENT     TYPES OF CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH BUSINESS PARTNERS IN A     VARIETY OF INDUSTRIES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE PARTNERED WITH     COSTCO AND DELTA AIR LINES TO OFFER CO-BRANDED CARDS FOR     CONSUMERS AND SMALL BUSINESSES, AND THROUGH OUR MEMBERSHIP     REWARDS PROGRAM WE HAVE PARTNERED WITH BUSINESSES IN MANY     INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY, TO OFFER BENEFITS TO     CARDMEMBER PARTICIPANTS. UNDER SOME TYPES OF THESE CONTRACTUAL     ARRANGEMENTS, UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN TRIGGERING EVENTS,     WE MAY BE OBLIGATED TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO CERTAIN CO-BRAND     PARTNERS, MERCHANTS, VENDORS AND CUSTOMERS. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE     TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THE TRIGGERING EVENTS, WE COULD     UNEXPECTEDLY HAVE TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO THESE PARTNERS, WHICH     COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND     RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. SIMILARLY, WE HAVE CREDIT RISK TO CERTAIN     CO-BRAND PARTNERS RELATING TO OUR PREPAYMENTS FOR LOYALTY     PROGRAM POINTS THAT WILL NOT BE FULLY REDEEMED FOR MULTI-YEAR     PERIODS. WE ARE ALSO EXPOSED TO RISK FROM BANKRUPTCIES,     RESTRUCTURINGS, CONSOLIDATIONS AND OTHER SIMILAR EVENTS THAT MAY     OCCUR IN ANY INDUSTRY REPRESENTING A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR     BILLED BUSINESS, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT PARTICULAR CARD     PRODUCTS AND SERVICES (AND BILLED BUSINESS GENERALLY) AND OUR     FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE     COULD BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED IF WE WERE OBLIGATED TO OR ELECTED     TO REIMBURSE CARDMEMBERS FOR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PURCHASED     FROM MERCHANTS THAT ARE BANKRUPT OR HAVE CEASED OPERATIONS.         THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR     BILLED BUSINESS AND IN RECENT YEARS HAS UNDERGONE BANKRUPTCIES,     RESTRUCTURINGS, CONSOLIDATIONS AND OTHER SIMILAR EVENTS. DURING     2010, THERE CONTINUED TO BE SIGNIFICANT CONSOLIDATION IN THE     AIRLINE INDUSTRY, PARTICULARLY IN THE UNITED STATES (E.G.,     UNITED AIRLINES/CONTINENTAL AIRLINES AND THE PENDING MERGER OF     SOUTHWEST AIRLINES AND AIRTRAN), THROUGH MERGERS     AND/OR     GRANTS OF ANTITRUST IMMUNITY TO AIRLINE ALLIANCES AND JOINT     VENTURES, AND THIS TREND COULD CONTINUE. IN PARTICULAR, THE     UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION HAS GRANTED ANTITRUST     IMMUNITY TO MEMBERS OF THE SKYTEAM, STAR AND ONEWORLD ALLIANCES,     ENABLING THE COVERED AIRLINES TO CLOSELY COORDINATE THEIR     CROSS-REGIONAL OPERATIONS AND TO LAUNCH HIGHLY INTEGRATED JOINT     VENTURES IN TRANSATLANTIC AND OTHER MARKETS, INCLUDING JOINTLY     PRICING AND MANAGING CAPACITY ON COVERED ROUTES, SHARING     REVENUES AND COSTS, AND COORDINATING SALES AND CORPORATE     CONTRACTS, ALL OUTSIDE OF THE SCOPE OF THE U.S. ANTITRUST     LAWS. THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION HAS SIMILARLY APPROVED THE     ONEWORLD ALLIANCE, AND ITS REVIEW OF THE OTHER ALLIANCES IS     CONTINUING. INCREASING CONSOLIDATION AND EXPANDED ANTITRUST     IMMUNITY COULD CREATE CHALLENGES FOR OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE     AIRLINES INCLUDING BY REDUCING OUR PROFITABILITY ON OUR AIRLINE     BUSINESS.         AIRLINES ARE ALSO SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT AND VALUABLE     PARTNERS IN OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM. IF A PARTICIPATING     AIRLINE MERGED WITH AN AIRLINE THAT DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN     MEMBERSHIP REWARDS, THE COMBINED AIRLINE WOULD HAVE TO DETERMINE     WHETHER OR NOT TO CONTINUE PARTICIPATION. SIMILARLY, IF ONE OF     OUR CO-BRAND          87    TABLE OF CONTENTS        AIRLINE PARTNERS MERGED WITH AN AIRLINE THAT HAD A COMPETING     CO-BRAND CARD, THE COMBINED AIRLINE WOULD HAVE TO DETERMINE     WHICH CO-BRAND CARDS IT WOULD OFFER. IF AN AIRLINE DETERMINED TO     WITHDRAW FROM MEMBERSHIP REWARDS OR TO CEASE OFFERING AN     AMERICAN EXPRESS CO-BRAND CARD, WHETHER AS THE RESULT OF A     MERGER OR OTHERWISE, SUCH AS OUR RECENT ANNOUNCEMENT THAT     CONTINENTAL AIRLINES WILL NO LONGER PARTICIPATE IN THE AIRPORT     CLUB ACCESS PROGRAM FOR CENTURION AND PLATINUM CARDMEMBERS OR     THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS POINTS TRANSFER PROGRAM AS OF     OCTOBER 1, 2011, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.     FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATING TO THE GENERAL RISKS RELATED     TO THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY, SEE \\x93FINANCIAL REVIEW \\x97     EXPOSURE TO AIRLINE INDUSTRY\\x94 ON PAGE 60 OF OUR 2010     ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY     REFERENCE.     OUR     REENGINEERING AND OTHER COST CONTROL INITIATIVES MAY NOT PROVE     SUCCESSFUL, AND WE MAY NOT REALIZE ALL OR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION     OF THE BENEFITS WE INTENDED.         WE HAVE REGULARLY UNDERTAKEN, AND ARE CURRENTLY UNDERTAKING, A     VARIETY OF EFFORTS TO REENGINEER OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS IN     ORDER TO ACHIEVE COST SAVINGS AND OTHER BENEFITS (INCLUDING THE     REINVESTMENT OF SUCH SAVINGS IN KEY AREAS SUCH AS MARKETING,     PROMOTION, REWARDS AND INFRASTRUCTURE), ENHANCE     REVENUE-GENERATING OPPORTUNITIES AND IMPROVE OUR OPERATING     EXPENSE TO REVENUE RATIO BOTH IN THE SHORT-TERM AND OVER TIME.     THESE EFFORTS INCLUDE COST MANAGEMENT, STRUCTURAL AND STRATEGIC     MEASURES SUCH AS VENDOR, PROCESS, FACILITIES AND OPERATIONS     CONSOLIDATION, OUTSOURCING FUNCTIONS (INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS,     TECHNOLOGIES OPERATIONS), RELOCATING CERTAIN FUNCTIONS TO LOWER     COST OVERSEAS LOCATIONS, MOVING INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FUNCTIONS     TO THE INTERNET TO SAVE COSTS AND PLANNED STAFF REDUCTIONS     RELATING TO CERTAIN OF THESE REENGINEERING ACTIONS. IF WE DO NOT     SUCCESSFULLY ACHIEVE THESE EFFORTS IN A TIMELY MANNER OR IF WE     ARE NOT ABLE TO CAPITALIZE ON THESE EFFORTS, INCLUDING THE     ABILITY OF THE GLOBAL SERVICES GROUP TO GENERATE AN ANNUALIZED     LEVEL OF GROSS EXPENSE SAVINGS OF APPROXIMATELY     $500 MILLION BY 2012, OR IF THE ACTIONS TAKEN ULTIMATELY     COME AT THE EXPENSE OF OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY, WE MAY NOT     REALIZE ALL OR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE BENEFITS WE     INTENDED. FAILURE TO ACHIEVE THESE BENEFITS COULD HAVE A     NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF     OPERATIONS.     OUR     RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES MAY NOT BE     EFFECTIVE.         WE MUST EFFECTIVELY MANAGE CREDIT RISK RELATED TO CONSUMER DEBT,     BUSINESS LOANS, SETTLEMENT RISK WITH REGARD TO GNS PARTNERS,     MERCHANT BANKRUPTCIES, THE RATE OF BANKRUPTCIES, AND OTHER     CREDIT TRENDS THAT CAN AFFECT SPENDING ON CARD PRODUCTS, DEBT     PAYMENTS BY INDIVIDUAL AND CORPORATE CUSTOMERS AND BUSINESSES     THAT ACCEPT OUR CARD PRODUCTS.         CREDIT RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS FROM OBLIGOR OR COUNTERPARTY     DEFAULT. WE ARE EXPOSED TO BOTH CONSUMER CREDIT RISK,     PRINCIPALLY FROM CARDMEMBER RECEIVABLES AND OUR OTHER CONSUMER     LENDING ACTIVITIES, AND INSTITUTIONAL CREDIT RISK FROM     MERCHANTS, GNS PARTNERS AND GCC CLIENTS. THIRD PARTIES MAY     DEFAULT ON THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US DUE TO BANKRUPTCY, LACK OF     LIQUIDITY, OPERATIONAL FAILURE OR OTHER REASONS. COUNTRY,     REGIONAL AND POLITICAL RISKS ARE COMPONENTS OF CREDIT RISK.     RISING DELINQUENCIES AND RISING RATES OF BANKRUPTCY ARE OFTEN     PRECURSORS OF FUTURE WRITE-OFFS AND MAY REQUIRE US TO INCREASE     OUR RESERVE FOR LOAN LOSSES. HIGHER WRITE-OFF RATES AND AN     INCREASE IN OUR RESERVE FOR LOAN LOSSES ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR     PROFITABILITY AND THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR SECURITIZATIONS, AND     MAY INCREASE OUR COST OF FUNDS.         ALTHOUGH WE MAKE ESTIMATES TO PROVIDE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN OUR     OUTSTANDING PORTFOLIO OF LOANS AND RECEIVABLES, THESE ESTIMATES     MAY NOT BE ACCURATE. IN ADDITION, THE INFORMATION WE USE IN     MANAGING OUR CREDIT RISK MAY BE INACCURATE OR INCOMPLETE.     ALTHOUGH WE REGULARLY REVIEW OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE TO SPECIFIC     CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES AND TO SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES, COUNTRIES     AND REGIONS THAT WE BELIEVE MAY PRESENT CREDIT CONCERNS, DEFAULT     RISK MAY ARISE FROM EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE DIFFICULT     TO FORESEE OR DETECT, SUCH AS FRAUD. WE MAY ALSO FAIL TO RECEIVE     FULL INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE CREDIT RISKS OF OUR     CUSTOMERS.         WE MUST ALSO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE MARKET RISK TO WHICH WE ARE     EXPOSED. MARKET RISK REPRESENTS THE LOSS IN VALUE OF PORTFOLIOS     AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS DUE TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN MARKET     VARIABLES. WE ARE EXPOSED TO MARKET RISK FROM INTEREST RATES IN     OUR CARD BUSINESS AND IN OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS. CHANGES IN     THE INTEREST RATES AT WHICH WE BORROW AND LEND MONEY AFFECT THE     VALUE OF OUR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. IF THE RATE OF INTEREST WE     PAY ON OUR BORROWINGS INCREASES MORE THAN THE RATE OF INTEREST     WE EARN ON OUR LOANS, OUR NET INTEREST YIELD, AND CONSEQUENTLY     OUR NET INCOME, COULD FALL.         88    TABLE OF CONTENTS        WE MUST ALSO ACCURATELY ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSETS IN     OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND, IN PARTICULAR, THOSE INVESTMENTS     THAT ARE NOT READILY MARKETABLE.         ADDITIONALLY, WE MUST EFFECTIVELY MANAGE LIQUIDITY RISK TO WHICH     WE ARE EXPOSED. LIQUIDITY RISK IS DEFINED AS THE INABILITY TO     ACCESS CASH AND EQUIVALENTS NEEDED TO MEET BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS     AND SATISFY OUR OBLIGATIONS. IF WE ARE UNSUCCESSFUL IN MANAGING     OUR LIQUIDITY RISK, WE MAY MAINTAIN TOO MUCH LIQUIDITY, WHICH     CAN BE COSTLY AND LIMIT FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY, OR WE MAY BE TOO     ILLIQUID, WHICH COULD RESULT IN FINANCIAL DISTRESS DURING A     LIQUIDITY EVENT. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR     MANAGEMENT OF LIQUIDITY RISK, SEE \\x93ADVERSE CAPITAL AND     CREDIT MARKET CONDITIONS MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO     MEET LIQUIDITY NEEDS, ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND COST OF     CAPITAL\\x94 ABOVE.         FINALLY, WE MUST ALSO MANAGE THE OPERATIONAL RISKS TO WHICH WE     ARE EXPOSED. WE CONSIDER OPERATIONAL RISK TO BE THE RISK OF NOT     ACHIEVING BUSINESS OBJECTIVES DUE TO INADEQUATE OR FAILED     PROCESSES OR INFORMATION SYSTEMS, HUMAN ERROR OR THE EXTERNAL     ENVIRONMENT (I.E., NATURAL DISASTERS) INCLUDING LOSSES DUE TO     FAILURES TO COMPLY WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS. OPERATIONAL RISKS     INCLUDE THE RISK THAT WE MAY NOT COMPLY WITH SPECIFIC REGULATORY     OR LEGAL REQUIREMENTS, EXPOSING US TO FINES     AND/OR     PENALTIES AND POSSIBLY BRAND DAMAGE; EMPLOYEE ERROR OR     INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT THAT RESULTS IN A MATERIAL FINANCIAL     MISSTATEMENT; OR A FAILURE TO MONITOR AN OUTSOURCE     PARTNER\\x92S COMPLIANCE WITH A SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT,     RESULTING IN ECONOMIC HARM TO US.         ALTHOUGH WE HAVE DEVOTED SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO DEVELOP OUR     RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE     TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE, OUR HEDGING STRATEGIES AND OTHER RISK     MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES MAY NOT BE FULLY EFFECTIVE. SEE     \\x93FINANCIAL REVIEW \\x97 RISK MANAGEMENT\\x94 ON     PAGES 48-50 OF OUR 2010 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS FOR A     DISCUSSION OF THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES WE USE TO IDENTIFY,     MONITOR AND MANAGE THE RISKS WE ASSUME IN CONDUCTING OUR     BUSINESSES. MANAGEMENT OF CREDIT, MARKET AND OPERATIONAL RISK     REQUIRES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO RECORD     PROPERLY AND VERIFY A LARGE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS AND EVENTS,     AND THESE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES MAY NOT BE FULLY EFFECTIVE.     AN     INABILITY TO ACCEPT OR MAINTAIN DEPOSITS DUE TO MARKET DEMAND OR     REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR     LIQUIDITY POSITION AND OUR ABILITY TO FUND OUR     BUSINESS.         AS A SOURCE OF FUNDING, OUR BANKING SUBSIDIARIES OFFER DEPOSITS     TO INDIVIDUALS THROUGH BROKERAGE NETWORKS AS WELL AS DIRECTLY TO     CONSUMERS.         AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY     $29.7 BILLION IN TOTAL CUSTOMER DEPOSITS. THE MAJORITY OF     THE COMPANY\\x92S OUTSTANDING U.S. RETAIL DEPOSITS HAVE     BEEN RAISED THROUGH THIRD-PARTY CHANNELS AND, AS SUCH, ARE     CONSIDERED BROKERED DEPOSITS FOR BANK REGULATORY PURPOSES. AS     PART OF OUR FUNDING STRATEGY, A MAJORITY OF THE DEPOSITS RAISED     DURING 2010 WERE SOURCED DIRECTLY BY THE COMPANY WITH CONSUMERS     THROUGH PERSONAL SAVINGS FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS. MANY OTHER     FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS ARE INCREASING THEIR USE OF DEPOSIT     FUNDING, AND AS SUCH WE MAY EXPERIENCE INCREASED COMPETITION IN     THE DEPOSIT MARKETS, PARTICULARLY AS TO BROKERAGE NETWORKS. WE     CANNOT PREDICT HOW THIS INCREASED COMPETITION WILL AFFECT     DEPOSIT RENEWAL RATES, COSTS OR AVAILABILITY. IF WE ARE REQUIRED     TO OFFER HIGHER INTEREST RATES TO ATTRACT OR MAINTAIN DEPOSITS,     OUR FUNDING COSTS WILL BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED.         OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN DEPOSIT FUNDING AND OFFER COMPETITIVE     INTEREST RATES ON DEPOSITS ALSO IS DEPENDENT ON CAPITAL LEVELS     OF OUR BANK SUBSIDIARIES. THE FDIA GENERALLY PROHIBITS A BANK,     INCLUDING OUR BANKING SUBSIDIARIES, FROM ACCEPTING BROKERED     DEPOSITS OR OFFERING INTEREST RATES ON ANY DEPOSITS     SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE PREVAILING RATE IN ITS NORMAL     MARKET AREA OR NATIONALLY (DEPENDING UPON WHERE THE DEPOSITS ARE     SOLICITED), UNLESS (1) IT IS WELL CAPITALIZED OR     (2) IT IS ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED AND RECEIVES A WAIVER FROM     THE FDIC. A BANK THAT IS LESS THAN WELL CAPITALIZED GENERALLY     MAY NOT PAY AN INTEREST RATE ON ANY DEPOSIT, INCLUDING     DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER     DEPOSITS, IN EXCESS OF 75 BASIS POINTS OVER THE NATIONAL     RATE PUBLISHED BY THE FDIC UNLESS THE FDIC DETERMINES THAT THE     BANK IS OPERATING IN A HIGH-RATE AREA. AN ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED     INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION MAY NOT ACCEPT, RENEW OR ROLL     OVER ANY BROKERED DEPOSIT UNLESS IT HAS APPLIED FOR AND BEEN     GRANTED A WAIVER OF THIS PROHIBITION BY THE FDIC.     UNDERCAPITALIZED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS MAY NOT SOLICIT     DEPOSITS BY OFFERING INTEREST RATES THAT ARE SIGNIFICANTLY     HIGHER THAN THE PREVAILING RATES OF INTEREST ON INSURED DEPOSITS     IN SUCH INSTITUTION\\x92S NORMAL MARKET AREAS OR IN THE MARKET     AREA IN WHICH SUCH DEPOSITS WOULD OTHERWISE BE ACCEPTED. THERE     ARE NO SUCH RESTRICTIONS ON A BANK THAT IS WELL CAPITALIZED     (PROVIDED SUCH BANK IS NOT SUBJECT TO A CAPITAL MAINTENANCE     PROVISION WITHIN A WRITTEN AGREEMENT, CONSENT ORDER, ORDER TO     CEASE AND          89    TABLE OF CONTENTS        DESIST, CAPITAL DIRECTIVE, OR PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION DIRECTIVE     ISSUED BY ITS FEDERAL REGULATOR). IF A DEPOSITORY     INSTITUTION\\x92S FEDERAL REGULATOR DETERMINES THAT IT IS IN AN     UNSAFE OR UNSOUND CONDITION OR IS ENGAGING IN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND     BANKING PRACTICES, THE REGULATOR MAY RECLASSIFY A WELL     CAPITALIZED INSTITUTION AS ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED, REQUIRE AN     ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED INSTITUTION TO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN     RESTRICTIONS AS IF IT WERE UNDERCAPITALIZED, AND REQUIRE AN     UNDERCAPITALIZED INSTITUTION TAKE CERTAIN ACTIONS APPLICABLE TO     SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERCAPITALIZED INSTITUTIONS.         WHILE CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB WERE CONSIDERED \\x93WELL     CAPITALIZED\\x94 FOR THESE PURPOSES AS OF DECEMBER 31,     2009 AND DECEMBER 31, 2010, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT     THEY WILL CONTINUE TO MEET THIS DEFINITION. BASEL III, WHEN     IMPLEMENTED BY THE U.S. BANKING AGENCIES AND FULLY     PHASED-IN, WILL REQUIRE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND THEIR BANK     SUBSIDIARIES TO MAINTAIN SUBSTANTIALLY MORE CAPITAL, WITH A     GREATER EMPHASIS ON COMMON EQUITY. ADDITIONALLY, OUR REGULATORS     CAN ADJUST THE REQUIREMENTS TO BE WELL CAPITALIZED AT ANY TIME     AND HAVE AUTHORITY TO PLACE LIMITATIONS ON OUR DEPOSIT     BUSINESSES, INCLUDING THE INTEREST RATE WE PAY ON DEPOSITS. AN     INABILITY TO ATTRACT OR MAINTAIN DEPOSITS IN THE FUTURE COULD     MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION AND OUR     ABILITY TO FUND OUR BUSINESS.     IF OUR GLOBAL NETWORK SYSTEMS ARE DISRUPTED OR WE ARE     UNABLE TO PROCESS TRANSACTIONS EFFICIENTLY OR AT ALL, OUR     REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY WOULD BE MATERIALLY REDUCED.         OUR TRANSACTION AUTHORIZATION, CLEARING AND SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS     MAY EXPERIENCE SERVICE INTERRUPTIONS AS A RESULT OF FIRE,     NATURAL DISASTERS, POWER LOSS, DISRUPTIONS IN LONG DISTANCE OR     LOCAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACCESS, FRAUD, TERRORISM OR ACCIDENT. A     NATURAL DISASTER OR OTHER PROBLEM AT OUR FACILITIES COULD     INTERRUPT OUR SERVICES. ADDITIONALLY, WE RELY ON THIRD-PARTY     SERVICE PROVIDERS FOR THE TIMELY TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION     ACROSS OUR GLOBAL NETWORK. IF A SERVICE PROVIDER FAILS TO     PROVIDE THE COMMUNICATIONS CAPACITY OR SERVICES WE REQUIRE, AS A     RESULT OF NATURAL DISASTER, OPERATIONAL DISRUPTION, TERRORISM OR     ANY OTHER REASON, THE FAILURE COULD INTERRUPT OUR SERVICES,     ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PERCEPTION OF OUR BRANDS\\x92 RELIABILITY     AND MATERIALLY REDUCE OUR REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY.     WE     RELY ON THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS OF VARIOUS COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND     OTHER SERVICES INTEGRAL TO THE OPERATIONS OF OUR BUSINESSES.     THESE THIRD PARTIES MAY ACT IN WAYS THAT COULD HARM OUR     BUSINESS.         WE OPERATE A SERVICE NETWORK AROUND THE WORLD.  IN     ORDER TO ACHIEVE COST AND OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES, WE OUTSOURCE     TO THIRD-PARTY VENDORS MANY OF THE COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND OTHER     SERVICES THAT ARE INTEGRAL TO THE OPERATIONS OF OUR GLOBAL     BUSINESSES. A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THIS OUTSOURCING OCCURS IN     DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CERTAIN     DECISIONS ARE SUBJECT TO THE CONTROL OF OUR THIRD-PARTY SERVICE     PROVIDERS AND THAT THESE DECISIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR     ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION, THE MANAGEMENT OF MULTIPLE THIRD-PARTY     VENDORS INCREASES OUR OPERATIONAL COMPLEXITY AND DECREASES OUR     CONTROL. IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT THE COST EFFICIENCIES OF     CERTAIN OUTSOURCINGS WILL DECREASE AS THE DEMAND FOR THESE     SERVICES INCREASES AROUND THE WORLD.     OUR     BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO THE EFFECTS OF WEATHER AND NATURAL     DISASTERS.         AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, NATURAL DISASTERS, SEVERE WEATHER     CONDITIONS AND OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENTS CAN HAVE A NEGATIVE     EFFECT ON THE COMPANY\\x92S BUSINESS. BECAUSE THE COMPANY     DERIVES A PORTION OF ITS REVENUES FROM TRAVEL-RELATED SPENDING,     ITS BUSINESS IS SENSITIVE TO DISRUPTIONS IN AIR TRAVEL AND OTHER     FORMS OF TRAVEL CAUSED BY SUCH EVENTS. SUCH DISRUPTIONS CAN     RESULT IN THE PAYMENT OF CLAIMS UNDER TRAVEL INTERRUPTION     INSURANCE POLICIES THAT THE COMPANY OFFERS AND, IF SUCH     DISRUPTIONS TO TRAVEL ARE PROLONGED, THEY CAN MATERIALLY     ADVERSELY AFFECT OVERALL TRAVEL-RELATED SPENDING. IF THE     CONDITIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE (OR SIMILAR ONES) RESULT IN     WIDESPREAD OR LENGTHY DISRUPTIONS TO TRAVEL, THEY COULD HAVE A     MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN OCTOBER 2008,     THE COMPANY RECEIVED A CIVIL INVESTIGATIVE DEMAND     (\\x93CID\\x94) FROM THE ANTITRUST DIVISION OF THE DOJ.     PURSUANT TO THE CID, THE DOJ REQUESTED THE PRODUCTION OF     DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANY\\x92S     CONTRACTUAL PROVISIONS RELATING TO MERCHANT SURCHARGING AND THAT     PROHIBIT MERCHANTS FROM DISCRIMINATING AGAINST AMERICAN EXPRESS     CARDS. THE COMPANY COOPERATED WITH THE DOJ\\x92S REQUEST. THE     COMPANY HAD ALSO RECEIVED A SIMILAR CIVIL INVESTIGATIVE DEMAND     FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF OHIO.         ON OCTOBER 4, 2010, THE DOJ, ALONG WITH ATTORNEYS GENERAL     FROM CONNECTICUT, IOWA, MARYLAND, MICHIGAN, MISSOURI, OHIO AND     TEXAS, FILED A COMPLAINT IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE     EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK AGAINST THE COMPANY, MASTERCARD     INTERNATIONAL INCORPORATED AND VISA, INC., ALLEGING A VIOLATION     OF SECTION 1 OF THE SHERMAN ANTITRUST ACT.

THE COMPLAINT SEEKS A JUDGMENT PERMANENTLY ENJOINING     THE DEFENDANTS FROM ENFORCING THEIR ANTI-STEERING AND     NON-DISCRIMINATION RULES AND CONTRACTUAL PROVISIONS.

THE DEFENDANTS FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS THE     COMPLAINT AND IN OCTOBER 2009, THE COURT DISMISSED THE COMPLAINT     AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS. THE PLAINTIFF HAD FILED A NOTICE OF     APPEAL OF THE DISMISSAL, BUT HAS SINCE INFORMED THE COMPANY THAT     IT DOES NOT INTEND TO PURSUE SUCH APPEAL.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY ET     AL., FILED ON FEBRUARY 10, 2009 IN THE UNITED STATES     DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. AMERICAN     EXPRESS FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS THESE ACTIONS. IN APRIL 2009,     THESE ACTIONS WERE CONSOLIDATED INTO A CONSOLIDATED AMENDED     COMPLAINT, CAPTIONED IN RE AMERICAN EXPRESS ERISA     LITIGATION. FOLLOWING ARGUMENT ON AMERICAN EXPRESS\\x92     MOTION TO DISMISS THIS ACTION, THE COURT PERMITTED PLAINTIFFS TO     FILE A SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT. IN APRIL 2010, AMERICAN EXPRESS     FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS THE SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT. ON     NOVEMBER 2, 2010, THE DISTRICT COURT DISMISSED THE SECOND     AMENDED COMPLAINT IN ITS ENTIRETY. ON DECEMBER 2, 2010,     PLAINTIFFS FILED A NOTICE OF APPEAL, APPEALING THE CASE TO THE     UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT. THAT     APPEAL IS CURRENTLY PENDING.         THE COMPANY IS A DEFENDANT IN A PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION CAPTIONED     KAUFMAN V. AMERICAN EXPRESS TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES,     WHICH WAS FILED ON FEBRUARY 14, 2007, AND IS PENDING IN THE     UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF     ILLINOIS. THE ALLEGATIONS IN KAUFMAN RELATE PRIMARILY TO MONTHLY     SERVICE FEE CHARGES IN RESPECT OF THE COMPANY\\x92S GIFT CARD     PRODUCTS, WITH THE PRINCIPAL CLAIM BEING THAT THE COMPANY\\x92S     GIFT CARDS VIOLATE CONSUMER PROTECTION STATUTES BECAUSE     CONSUMERS ALLEGEDLY HAVE DIFFICULTY SPENDING SMALL RESIDUAL     AMOUNTS ON THE GIFT CARDS PRIOR TO THE IMPOSITION OF MONTHLY     SERVICE FEES. IN JANUARY 2009, THE COMPANY SIGNED A MEMORANDUM     OF UNDERSTANDING TO RESOLVE THESE CLAIMS. SINCE SUCH TIME, THE     PARTIES HAVE ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT THAT WAS     SUBMITTED TO THE COURT FOR PRELIMINARY APPROVAL. THE PROPOSED     SETTLEMENT CLASS CONSISTS OF \\x93ALL PURCHASERS, RECIPIENTS     AND HOLDERS OF ALL GIFT CARDS ISSUED BY AMERICAN EXPRESS FROM     JANUARY 1, 2002 THROUGH THE DATE OF PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF     THE SETTLEMENT, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, GIFT CARDS SOLD AT     PHYSICAL RETAIL LOCATIONS, VIA THE INTERNET, OR THROUGH MALL     CO-BRANDED PROGRAMS.\\x94 UNDER THE TERMS OF THE PROPOSED     SETTLEMENT, IN ADDITION TO CERTAIN NON-MONETARY RELIEF, THE     COMPANY WOULD PAY $3 MILLION INTO A SETTLEMENT FUND.     MEMBERS OF THE SETTLEMENT CLASS WOULD THEN BE ENTITLED TO SUBMIT     CLAIMS AGAINST THE SETTLEMENT FUND TO RECEIVE REFUNDS OF CERTAIN     GIFT CARD FEES, AND ANY MONIES REMAINING IN THE SETTLEMENT FUND     AFTER PAYMENT OF ALL CLAIMS WOULD BE PAID TO CHARITY. IN     ADDITION, THE COMPANY WOULD MAKE AVAILABLE TO THE SETTLEMENT     CLASS FOR A PERIOD OF TIME THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUY GIFT CARDS     WITH NO PURCHASE FEE. FINALLY, THE COMPANY WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE     FOR PAYING CLASS COUNSEL\\x92S REASONABLE FEES AND EXPENSES AND     CERTAIN EXPENSES OF ADMINISTERING THE CLASS SETTLEMENT. THE     COMPANY IS ALSO A DEFENDANT IN TWO OTHER PUTATIVE CLASS ACTIONS     MAKING ALLEGATIONS SIMILAR TO THOSE MADE IN KAUFMAN:     GOODMAN V. AMERICAN EXPRESS           93    TABLE OF CONTENTS    TRAVEL     RELATED SERVICES, PENDING IN THE UNITED STATES     DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, AND     JARRATT V. AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY, FILED IN     CALIFORNIA SUPERIOR COURT IN SAN DIEGO AND SUBSEQUENTLY     REMOVED TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN     DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA. IF THE COURT ULTIMATELY APPROVES THE     PROPOSED SETTLEMENT IN KAUFMAN, ALL RELATED GIFT CARD     CLAIMS AND ACTIONS WOULD ALSO BE RELEASED. IN AUGUST 2010, IN     RESPONSE TO OBJECTIONS BY PLAINTIFFS IN CERTAIN OF THE OTHER     PENDING CASES, THE KAUFMAN COURT PARTIALLY GRANTED AND     PARTIALLY DENIED APPROVAL OF THE SETTLEMENT. THE COMPANY HAS     FILED A MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF THE PORTION OF THE     COURT\\x92S DECISION PARTIALLY DENYING APPROVAL OF THE     SETTLEMENT, AND THAT MOTION IS PENDING.

THE ACTIONS SEEK     UNSPECIFIED COMPENSATORY DAMAGES AS WELL AS DISGORGEMENT,     PUNITIVE DAMAGES, ATTORNEYS\\x92 FEES AND COSTS, AND INTEREST.     ON MARCH 31, 2004, THE COURT GRANTED THE COMPANY\\x92S     MOTION TO DISMISS THE LAWSUIT. PLAINTIFFS APPEALED THE DISMISSAL     TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT. IN     AUGUST 2006, THE COURT OF APPEALS, WITHOUT EXPRESSING ANY VIEWS     WHATSOEVER ON THE MERITS OF THE CASES, VACATED THE DISTRICT     COURT\\x92S JUDGMENT AND REMANDED ALL CLAIMS TO THE DISTRICT     COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS. PLAINTIFFS FILED AN AMENDED     COMPLAINT ON JANUARY 5, 2007. THE COMPANY SUBSEQUENTLY     FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS THE AMENDED COMPLAINT, WHICH MOTION     WAS GRANTED IN SEPTEMBER 2008.

THE COMPANY FILED A REVISED MOTION TO     COMPEL ARBITRATION AND A MOTION TO DISMISS THE AMENDED     COMPLAINT. BOTH MOTIONS WERE DENIED BY THE COURT. SUBSEQUENTLY,     IN RESPONSE TO A REQUEST BY THE COMPANY, THE COURT STAYED THE     ACTION PENDING THE OUTCOME OF A CASE CAPTIONED AT&T     MOBILITY V.

THE CASE WENT     TO TRIAL IN NOVEMBER 2008 AND JANUARY TO FEBRUARY 2009. AMERICAN     EXPRESS WAS GRANTED JUDGMENT ON ALL COUNTS. THE PLAINTIFFS HAVE     FILED A NOTICE OF APPEAL; AMERICAN EXPRESS HAS FILED A     PROTECTIVE NOTICE OF APPEAL TO PRESERVE CERTAIN LEGAL ISSUES.         IN ADDITION, A CASE MAKING THE SAME FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS     (PURPORTEDLY ON BEHALF OF A DIFFERENT CLASS OF CARDMEMBERS) AS     THOSE IN THE HOFFMAN CASE IS PENDING IN THE UNITED STATES     DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, ENTITLED     LAW ENFORCEMENT SYSTEMS V. AMERICAN EXPRESS ET AL.     THAT CASE WAS STAYED PENDING THE TRIAL IN THE HOFFMAN     ACTION.

THE COURT DENIED THE     REQUEST. NO OTHER ACTIVITY HAS OCCURRED IN THAT CASE. FURTHER,     ON OCTOBER 30, 2008, A PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION ON BEHALF OF     AMERICAN EXPRESS CREDIT CARDMEMBERS MAKING THE SAME ALLEGATIONS     AS THOSE RAISED IN THE HOFFMAN AND LAW ENFORCEMENT     SYSTEMS CASES WAS FILED IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT     FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA, CAPTIONED KASS V.

IN MAY 2007, THE     DISTRICT COURT GRANTED THE COMPANY\\x92S MOTION TO COMPEL     INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND DISMISSED THE COMPLAINT. PLAINTIFF     APPEALED THAT DECISION TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR     THE THIRD CIRCUIT, AND IN FEBRUARY 2009, THE THIRD CIRCUIT     REVERSED THE DECISION AND REMANDED THE CASE BACK TO THE DISTRICT     COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS. IN OCTOBER 2009, A PUTATIVE CLASS     ACTION CAPTIONED PAGSOLINGAN V. AMERICAN EXPRESS     COMPANY, ET AL. WAS FILED IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT     COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA.
